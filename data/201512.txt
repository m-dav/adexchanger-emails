 <http://go.adexchanger.com/gp0D40L0q20CBA0AW000KjP> FTC Issues Native Ad Enforcement Policy: Disclosure Must Precede The Click
The FTC’s native advertising guide makes it clear that while the primary responsibility lies with the advertiser, it will hold accountable “everyone who participates directly or indirectly in creating or presenting native ads,” a group that would include ad tech companies and publishers.

Messaging apps have the first-party identity data that makes Facebook and its counterparts so attractive and, in addition to identity and reach, messengers will start to provide more contextual data – especially if people are able to enjoy the functionality of the Internet within messenger platforms.

News Round Up

Peddle Your ‘Wares

Microsoft will update its Windows PCs in 2016 to purge any insecure adware code in the system. The move is mostly to kill off those man-in-the-middle ad injections. “Our intent is to keep the user in control of their browsing experience, and these methods reduce that control,” Microsoft said in a statement <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DwA02000BWj0q4CRLP0A> . The most high-profile example of Ads Gone Wild happened in February, when device manufacturer Lenovo <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000j2xC0L0B0SA4PDAq>  decided it would be a spectacular idea to dump Superfish software onto its computers, which injected ads and created lingering security loopholes, even after users removed Superfish from the pond. The ad tech community no longer gets the benefit of the doubt, says Microsoft. “Programs that create advertisements in browsers must only use the browsers’ supported extensibility model for installation, execution, disabling and removal.” Read more on The Guardian <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00T0yL0jW00AD2q0CA04> .

Seeing The Light

Beacons have passed the adoption tipping point. IKEA, Macy’s, McDonald’s and even Facebook will be deploying tens of thousands of beacons across the country, with hundreds of millions in all expected over the next five years, writes Kate Kaye at Ad Age. But those beacons mean different things for different stakeholders. For marketers, “What's at stake is finally bringing offline attribution to reality, with big implications for tracking ROI,” says BIA/Kelsey chief analyst Mike Boland. Retailers see a chance to monetize their underdeveloped data. On the other hand, consumers might rather do without the pings, emails, notifications, download prompts and opt-ins.

Chop-Chop

A Pew Research Center study on home broadband uptake yielded three key takeaways, some of which have implications for advertisers. First, US home broadband use slightly declined (67% of Americans had it compared to 70% in 2013), partially because of the price of service. Second and simultaneously, more households are going smartphone-only (13% compared to 8% in 2013). Third and most relevant to advertisers: 15% of US adults identify themselves as cord-cutters – meaning they canceled their cable or satellite service. Nine percent of US adults said they never had either. Of that 24% of US adults who don’t have cable or satellite TV, 71% say it’s because cable/satellite is too expensive and 64% say they get their content either via antenna or through online streaming.

Social Meh-dia

Twitter is developing a timeline akin to Facebook’s Newsfeed, which displays posts algorithmically and not chronologically. Does that matter to advertisers? For most, organic reach (the numbers of users exposed to an ad) will go down. But Twitter could account for the loss in reach with better engagement numbers. It’s also worth bearing in mind that products released since Jack Dorsey took over, such as Moments, are geared toward the the hundreds of one-time users who don’t return for every one that does. One anonymous agency rep tells Digiday’s Garett Sloane that “At this point, you need to be jaded, because Facebook trained us to be really jaded.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0CqW0D00WABB0j4PA> .

News Round Up

Bezos’ WaPo

In the two years that Jeff Bezos has owned the Washington Post, the publisher’s digital traffic has surpassed that of The New York Times and has begun to close on Buzzfeed. The Wall Street Journal delivers the profile treatment. “The narrative around the growth and the Post ’winning’ is great, but (Bezos) knows the only number that really matters is the digital subscription number,” says one anonymous source, who rightly points to The NYT’s progress on that front (whereas WaPo’s growth has been driven by social media). There are unique advantages, though, including this one: Bezos gets to bundle WaPo into Amazon offers (like a free subscription for Prime members). Commerce/content synergy! More <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PuB00000Af4Dq02CWd0> . And Bloomberg has its own WaPo-under-Bezos think piece <http://go.adexchanger.com/lfBqv000LCDP0A2A4000e0W> .

All Engines Go

Search is fragmenting. Although eMarketer estimates that Google will account for 54.5% of the global paid search market in 2015, that share is down from 54.7% in 2014 and 55.2% in 2013. Fracturing the US search triumvirate of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are international companies like Baidu (second behind Google in overall revenue) as well as voice command search, messaging apps, powerhouses like Facebook and Amazon and search-and-intent upstarts like Relcy or Button. Don’t shed any tears though – even if Google’s market share is slimming, the market itself continues to grow. More at MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lff2wADP0C00A0> .

Strategic Shift

Holding companies like Publicis and WPP Group remain the white-hot core of agency M&A, but consulting firms are giving them a run for their money (ICF International recently spent <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqxB0C2LW004D0P0AAg0f00>  $295 million on a mid-size shop). That’s one takeaway from an AdMedia survey of ad industry merger activity, covered by David Gianastano for Adweek. Another finding: Agencies interested in selling one day should build capabilities in areas such as ad tech, content development and research. "You've got a sense that just being a great creative shop, it's nice, but it's not enough anymore," said Mike Alpert, AdMedia’s managing director. "Certainly, if you're one of the major buyers, you've already got plenty of that stuff.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0f0P4qA02000WLh0y0ACDB> .

M&Ashable

This year’s parade of buyers and investors pumping hundreds of millions into new media publishers isn’t over yet. Anonymous sources tell Ken Doctor, writing for Politico’s Capital NY, that Mashable is being shopped for $250 to $350 million. Time Warner, a previous investor in Mashable, has supposedly considered a bid. The news comes weeks after Vice raised another $200 million from Disney, not to mention the hundreds of millions Comcast  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000f2iC0L0B0zA4PDAq> poured into Buzzfeed.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0b0P4qA02000WLv0I0ACDB> GroupM Acquires The Exchange Lab To Combat Digital Buying Fragmentation
Despite the issues of digital media fragmentation, it’s not clear if aggregating those disparate sources is truly beneficial. Naysayers point to problems around user duplication, brands unintentionally bidding against themselves and some loss of control over frequency (i.e., the agency doesn’t know if it’s saturating individuals through multiple ad servers).

News Round Up

Leadership Change At Criteo

Eric Eichmann, once Criteo’s COO and president, is now its CEO. JB Rudelle, once its CEO and chairman, is now its executive chairman. “This evolution comes at the right time for Criteo”, Rudelle said in a statement. “As we head towards the end of 2015, I am very excited about the momentum of our business and confident about the outlook we provided on November 4, 2015.” Criteo’s future initiatives <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000b2DC0L0B0QA4PDAq>  include the development of a cross-device identity matching product as well as email personalization.

Fallen Angels

VCs aren’t just giving money out the way they used to, according to an article by CNBC’s Ari Levy. "It's been surprising to see how quickly valuation expectations are recalibrating," says Next World Capital partner Craig Hanson."Rounds will be harder to raise, valuation multiples will be lower and, in many cases, companies will have to demonstrate metrics that back up the big projections they promised before." Bain Capital managing director Ajay Agarwal says, “The world of perpetual up rounds is over … That's forcing companies that are much younger to think about cash and profitability in ways they haven't had to.” George Zachary, partner at Charles River, says that nowadays, "At every board meeting, we're reviewing burn rates.” Read it here <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0bWD0LS000B4000CF> .

D Is For Data – And Drama

Democratic politics erupted last week when it was revealed that Senator Bernie Sanders’ aides had accessed proprietary data from Hillary Clinton’s campaign. The DNC then cut off the Sanders campaign from accessing voter data. The campaign filed a breach of contract lawsuit against the DNC, which remains active even after the organization restored Sanders’ access to the voter files. The legal feud shows how vital voter data is in modern campaigning. The lawsuit claims that, without the vote files, “The damage to the campaign’s political viability, as a result of being unable to communicate with constituents and voters, is far more severe and incapable of measurement.” The breach also highlights the potential dangers when firewalls fail. In a statement, Sanders said Clinton’s data was compromised “because the DNC and its vendor failed to to protect it <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000T2040qACLPDBbG0WA0> .” Regardless of this narrative, the senator apologized for the breach during the Democratic debate Saturday.

The Mighty Amazon

According to a Bloomberg report <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0b0P4qA02000WLI0V0ACDB> , Amazon accounts for more online sales than the combined total of the next 21 largest retailers – including Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Macy’s, Home Depot, Nordstrom, Costco, you get the point – and is actually widening that lead. A CNBC ecommerce article <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0Jb0LC0DB0W0W0q4P20A0A>  notes that major Amazon tech and delivery-fulfillment investments were criticized for “the drain on profitability (they) caused." But now Amazon "is seeing the payoff on those investments." Amazon has been a friend to cargo companies like UPS and FedEx, but the ecommerce beast’s next meal may be the entire shipping segment of the supply chain. The airfreight trade pub Cargo Facts <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0XL0000bP02BAqDC0K40A>  broke the news that Amazon is considering its own fleet and air logistics operation.

News Round Up

TV’s Royal Rumble

When streaming services like Netflix and Hulu took off, they were just the dumb pipes for broadcasters (a nice recurring revenue stream beyond TV syndication). But digital players are fueling a huge increase in scripted programming – nearly doubling since 2009 – which is ratcheting up the competition, according to a WSJ report <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPCy08q0AD00B4I020W0>  from Joe Flint. But it’s the quality, not quantity, that hurts in the end. Netflix, HBO and AMC have seen that if they produce the top-rated shows <http://go.adexchanger.com/uz0000DB4L0A0J028PqWAC0> , their leverage over traditional broadcasters jumps by multiples, and paid media will follow.

Can’t Shake It

Digital media companies would love to imitate BuzzFeed and make their money through sponsored content. But try as they might, display remains the meat-and-potatoes revenue stream. Mic CEO Chris Altchek said in late 2014 that his site would quit display ads, but in fact Mic has expanded its display offerings. Mashable CRO Seth Rogin tells Ad Age’s Jeremy Barr that "[d]isplay advertising works, and we know that because advertisers who buy with us are voting with their dollars and coming back time and time again."

Pinterest’s Wish List

Pinterest will use email alerts to notify users of price changes for products they’ve saved on its platform. Blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/GCB0A820DL4BW0AL0000P0q> . Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have struggled as shopping platforms, but that’s Pinterest’s unique forte. Pinterest’s ecommerce rival isn’t social media, it’s email retargeters. This is why the company can turn its back on whole advertising categories <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DW84CA00ML0PB0C2>  – when it starts really making cash, it’ll come in the form of DR sales.

Mobile Turf Wars

Lyft recently teamed up with some of Asia’s most powerful mobile and transportation players (such as the ride-hailer Didi, which is owned in part by WeChat), in a deal that was more about boxing  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000082DC0L0B0NA4PDAq> out Uber than elevating their own products. And Uber is responding in kind, with a Facebook partnership announced Wednesday that gives Uber prime real estate on Facebook’s Messenger chat app. Facebook, which is banned in China, is tacking closely in WeChat’s wake. “The question is which ones of these will be core,” Gartner analyst Eric Blau tells The New York Times. “We are still in relatively early days for messaging platforms.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q08WD0LO000B4000CE> .

I’d posit CMOs could double their digital marketing efficiency just by using a single platform and any reasonable attribution model within the DSP, not just cross-channel.

Scott Messer, senior director of business development at Demand Media, said Demand Media data shows a 25% lift in user engagement with the cinemagraph format compared to static images – which trades in the same standardized inventory and at the same rate.

News Round Up

brAIny

On the heels of Facebook’s new “Big Sur” ad servers <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tq0W20P0C000DBm20L4qAA0>  for AI computing and Google’s quantum computing technology <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0n20LC0DB0r0W0q4P20A0A>  for AI and predictive search marketing, IBM has opened access to Watson, its AI engine, via a set of API integrations. These tech power players can’t nail down precise end goals or use cases, but they all clearly see advanced AI capabilities as one of, if not the, killer applications for future marketing platforms. More at Fast Company <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PsB00000A24Dq02CWo0> .

Throwing Its Weight Around

Blake Ross, former Facebook product director and Firefox co-founder, has an insightful Medium post evaluating recent Facebook product changes. The social giant recently announced a new local search application that was hailed as a “Yelp killer <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00pWqA000CP2A0t040D2L> ,” but it’s not actually seeing any internal prioritization (though it did knock $200 million off Yelp’s market cap). Facebook has also started ranking content and shopping opportunities over humans in its search bar. It gets less attention than the phantom Yelp killer, but it’s far more consequential. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/iu2W00BCPqL00A000Dq2A04> .

Back To Basics

In India, Silicon Valley product expansion requires building infrastructure. For instance, Alphabet is working with the Indian government to add Wi-Fi to rail stations and investing in “Project Loon,” which aims to spread Internet to rural towns with high-altitude balloons, which in turn are in a heated race with Facebook’s Indian Internet expansion plans <http://go.adexchanger.com/f002A0L0Dr00CB2qW0AvP04> . The WSJ’s Newley Purnell cites a McKinsey report showing more than 1 billion Indians without Internet, “and Google is keen for new users to engage with its services, including search, Gmail and video service YouTube.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000w2040qACLPDB2s0WA0> .

Time To Make The Content

Content marketing is no longer an editorial quagmire or a vague hypothetical. It’s here and almost every major publisher has embraced some form of sponsored content creation. Which means it’s time to start thinking about standards and best practices for the quasi-journalistic, client-facing role. Writing for the Harvard Business Review, Alexandra Samuel assembles a list of what she sees solidifying in the space. Check it  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PxB00000A24Dq02CWt0> out.

“One of the sea changes you’ll see in TV with the investment in ad technology, in addition to more premium ad experiences, is more data and targeting through programmatic solutions and more means to secure backfill,” said David Levy, co-founder and COO for True[X]. “You’ll start to see much higher monetization per view.”

“Content is a long-term business,” Mark Curtis, founder and chief client officer of Fjord, said. “It’s extremely difficult to build a media brand, and generally shoe manufacturers can’t do it.”

The two dominant mobile ad servers, MoPub and DoubleClick for Publishers, use price estimates of bids from RTB demand sources, not confirmed prices, to choose who gets to serve an ad. When publishers go by these estimates, they can lose out on revenue.

News Round Up

Now You See Me

For gaming publishers, ad blocking is a big concern. About 40% of gaming media network IGN’s audience deploys ad blockers, Ad Age reports. Interestingly, mobile ad blocker adoption is negligible at about 2% of users, suggesting Apple’s support for such apps has not (yet) been as catastrophic as some feared. There are competing forces at work, says IGN’s Todd Northcutt. Advertisers want to “make sure ads are impactful, robust and video-heavy as much as possible. But that can impact users, too, with heavy ad load times and heavy video ad units.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/ur0000DB4L0A0q02YPqWAB0> .

Pound The Pavement

Vice is launching a new feature, City Guides, which will be an interactive mobile map (starting with Brooklyn, of course). The content will be paired with a new video series, Streets by Vice, that aims to explore iconic city streets, reports Tim Baysinger of Adweek. Potential synergies abound (from deals with bars and restaurants to travel and tourism marketing budgets). The idea is eerily reminiscent of a “Hidden Cities” project <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PBr00q2s0Y>  being produced by the Financial Times and Google Maps, which will explore non-touristy destinations in select cities.

Waking From A Dream

Since September, Pinterest has scaled back advertising services outside of the company’s core retail and CPG categories, according to a letter to its clients obtained by Mike Shields <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PtDYA40LBB00uA>  of The Wall Street Journal. “I was really surprised to receive a note [saying] that we’d no longer receive such support,” said Bank of America SVP Lou Paskalis, whose brand no longer gets direct Pinterest attention, but must advertise with the social platform via ad tech intermediaries. This news is hard to square with info someone leaked to TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00YA0L0Dv00BB2qW0AuP04>  in October laying out ambitious revenue expectations (from $25M now to $3B by 2018).

Popcorn Flick

When “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace” came out in 1998, the only way to see the trailer was to go to the movies. Josh Dzieza writes at The Verge how film marketing has evolved since then. For instance, trailers have gone from standalone pieces (like old album covers), to 15-second frontloaded bites built for social media sharing. Welcome to the new world of entertainment drip campaigns, where trailers are video snippets and movies are trailers for the next film in the franchise.

News Round Up

Old News

Turner Broadcasting hopes CNN can extract more value from its audience with a “new” data-driven strategy, reports Jessica Davies of Digiday. The service, which it’s calling Audience Insights Measurement, will enable more granular data on CNN readers to help marketers in their planning. CNN was late to the game with its <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PB800q2d0U>  branded content studio, and the same is true of its programmatic adoption. “It’s often forgotten that publishers also do well out of programmatic, not just the agencies,” says Robert Bradley, who will be building out Turner’s digital ad offering.

Reimagining Retail

Walmart and Amazon, ever the two great powers in the brick-and-mortar vs. ecommerce cold war, are advancing on new price strategies enabled by tech solutions. In this environment, even Walmart’s low price guarantee isn’t enough to compete with its dynamic digital rival, Kate Kaye reports for Ad Age. Consider: On Black Friday 16% of Amazon’s product prices fluctuated from the prior day, according to the data firm 360pi, while only 12% of Walmart prices fluctuated (and only 5% of Target’s prices did). 360pi VP Jenn Markey says she already “see(s) an increased level of algorithmic pricing,” as ecommerce players figure out how to bundle multi-product promo deals, manage supply chain margins and personalize in-cart prices.

Change Of Scenery

Social media is turning into private media, though nobody’s exactly sure what it means for users or advertisers. A Nieman Lab reporting team takes a look at the younger generation of social platform (think Snapchat, Slack, WeChat and Facebook Messenger) and finds users are more difficult to pin down. The social news feed/timeline model of search and digital may be in decline;  Twitter’s US user base is stagnant and Facebook’s investments seem geared toward adjacent products like Facebook M, Notify and WhatsApp. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0bL0000UP02BAqDB0g40A> .

Xaxis Moves

Xaxis named a new CEO for North America. Matt Sweeney replaces Brian Gleason, who was promoted to run Xaxis globally after the WPP Group trading desk’s former CEO, Brian Lesser, took a broader role with GroupM (AdExchanger story <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PcBhD000qA2U04L0B> ). Sweeney is credited with boosting Xaxis’ direct-to-client business in the US and helped launch Light Reaction, a performance marketing agency.

The Yahoo exodus – and Fuloria’s departure in particular – appear to signal that the linchpin players tasked with righting the Yahoo ship no longer have faith in Marissa Mayer’s ability to guide the turnaround.

News Round Up

Can You Hear Us?

In 2013, the FCC began enforcing regulations against TV broadcasters that aired commercials louder than programming. But streaming services slip through a loophole in that policy, and Vice reports on services like Sling TV and individual networks that have migrated the terrible practice online, placing marginal advertiser benefits ahead of user experience. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/ut0000DB4L0A0j02PPqWAB0> .
Scattering Cash

For a minute there it looked like networks and advertisers were going through <http://go.adexchanger.com/lPBqk000LBDP0A2A4000u0W>  a painful breakup, with upfront commitments shrinking as linear TV viewing stumbled. But declining upfront sales have been more than made up for by a thriving scatter market. Says a gloating Toby Byrne, Fox Networks Group president, “Unlike the last couple years, where scatter wasn't as strong and they either chose to put those flexible numbers to the bottom line or to spend them in new opportunities or new media, the dollars have found their way into the premium television marketplace.” More at Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4P0l0P00qD002LBW0vAB> .

Petrified Publicis

L’Oréal announced late last week that it would be consolidating its media planning and buying with MEC, at the expense of Publicis <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0PA0DB0Ww2Lq00BA00m4P0> . That came only days after Publicis found out it would be losing most of the budgets <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0BnA0q0x0BAL0PDP2>  it managed on behalf of P&G, a longstanding client and the world’s largest advertiser. Dentsu also recently leapfrogged Publicis <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02y000oP00BPW04DABAqL0>  to take on more of the Mondelez media budget. Ouch.

FTC  <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0CKBWPn0A00> at Industry Preview, January 20-21, Grand Hyatt New York - Day 1, 11:50 a.m.: Commissioner Brill’s purview at the The Federal Trade Commission has given her a unique view on the evolution of media and advertising – particularly as "Big Data" has continued to grow and the protection of a consumer’s privacy remains crucial and more complex than ever. She’ll address the relevant challenges and opportunities in the year ahead from the FTC’s point-of-view. Sponsored by Inneractive and Integral Ad Science

News Round Up

A Hole In Your Pocket

Networks of smartphone apps have been tracking user locations every three minutes, even when the app isn’t in use. Elizabeth Dwoskin of The Wall Street Journal reports on one mobile data provider, Factual, that is using those location streams for audience targeting (based on, say, a morning commute, or knowing a user goes to the gym five days a week). It’s framed as an opportunity for smaller apps to compete against Facebook and Google. “We’re giving mobile apps the data arsenal they need to thrive in a world increasingly dominated by a handful of giants,” said Factual CEO Gil Elbaz. Will that arsenal be turned on publishers once users catch wind of it? More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4K0w0P00qD002LBW0LAB> .

And The Award Goes To...

Cable TV disintegration <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0KA0DB0WM2Lq00BA00x4P0>  often seems like a natural force, as inevitable as gravity. But that discredits a lot of the value streaming and OTT players are bringing to the industry. Sarah Perez notes at TechCrunch that Netflix leads the pack with eight Golden Globe nominations this year, with HBO, Showtime and Amazon Prime not far behind. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PN40K0DyABq2> . You can tweak products and acquire tech, but in the end the best content will win. And ads will follow.

CMO Musical Chairs

Walmart CMO Stephen Quinn has stepped down, the latest in a string of exits of top marketers from major brands, and will be replaced by a marketing wunderkind from Target’s ranks. More in WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tz0WK0P0B000DBO20L4qAA0> . Eventually CMO churn will bring more marketing execs with data-driven mindsets, such as Deanie Elsner, the pro-platform former CMO at Kraft who recently jumped to Kellogg’s. The future is never easy.

News Round Up

Yahoo Goes To The Light

Will Yahoo’s reversal of its planned Alibaba spinoff, announced Wednesday <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PBg00q2y0H> , have the desired effect on its core media and advertising business? That is to say, will it raise the valuation of that business above effectively zero? Marissa Mayer told investors, “With a large portion of market cap driven by the Alibaba stake, separation will ... ensure Yahoo’s business operations are appropriately valued.” It’s a separate question whether the spinoff will spark a bidding war among potential acquirers, including telcos, private equity firms and big media companies. Such an outcome may be for the best after so many years of fretting about this underperformer.

Sweating Out The Ad Block Fever

A net 9% of the US digital consumer base “will opt out of advertising in the next three months,” claims Digital Content Next (DCN) in an ad-block report released today. Ad blocking is very real, but the alarm bells can be excessive. The Apple App Store’s most popular ad blocker, Crystal, went from the No. 1 paid download in October to outside the top 400 now, according to App Annie data. The Nieman Lab article <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DBBqA0020P0WzAHh00>  on DCN’s report also cites a PageFair/Adobe ad-block study that was compellingly debunked <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWH4BA00iL0PB0A2>  by BuzzFeed’s Alex Kantrowitz.

Get Real

With massive investments from the likes of Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Samsung, there’s a consensus that virtual reality is coming and will be big when it arrives. But with lots of work still to do before it takes off in video games and entertainment, marketers have mostly kept VR in the freezer. Until now, apparently. Digiday’s Garett Sloane reports Facebook is actively shopping its Oculus Rift tech as a marketing opportunity. Some brands <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0Bj02q0L0AB0DB00AH4>  have already tapped Facebook’s 360-degree video, a key stepping stone for its VR ambitions.

Instant Feedback

Facebook’s Instant Articles (IA) product has been hailed as both a blessing and a curse for publishers, but they seem to be ironing out their disputes. Jack Marshall has news on a few product tweaks meant to empower publishers. For one, Facebook used to demand pubs sell IA inventory at the same rates as their own site – to avoid advertisers buying at mixed rates – but dropped that restriction so publisher partners could upsell IA inventory. “We’re continuing to listen to publishers about what they want from Instant Articles, and we’re going to continue to do this,” said Michael Reckhow, the product manager for Instant Articles.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40U0A2E0BzLD0WBP00q0A0> Post-IPO, Square Uses Marketing Support To Get Cozier With SMBs
"Square has a fairly good chance of penetrating the small business market with their add-on marketing services mainly because it’s a logical extension of their point-of-sale service," Greg Sterling, VP of strategy and insights at Local Search Association, said. "Small businesses also want to deal with fewer rather than more vendors."

For publishers whose content resonates with the Pinterest audience, the platform can be very giving. For one, it actually links out to the publisher. And posts on Pinterest refer traffic longer than other social networks.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/qBAW0A0DLI004F02B0P200q> AdExchanger Politics column...The 2016 Election Will Disrupt Marketers’ Social Strategies by Mitch Dunn, Empower MediaMarketing
One notable trait of political campaigns is that they will typically focus on extremely small segments of the population, also known as microtargeting, and spend liberally to reach these specific segments. Thus, if a marketer is also targeting similar segments on Facebook, they may notice higher CPMs than normal for brief periods of time.

News Round Up

Arrgh Blocking

A bunch of brands and agencies have thrown their weight behind the Trustworthy Accountability Group’s (TAG) plan <http://go.adexchanger.com/o023000JF00BPW04DABAqL0>  to avoid advertising on pirated media. Backers include Allstate, Amex, Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg’s, MillerCoors NBCU and Unilever, plus agencies like MediaCom, MediaVest and Mindshare. The IAB recently <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PKDFA40LBB004A>  estimated that media owners are hemorrhaging around $2.4B a year because of stolen content. More on that <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPB50Fq0AD00B4L020W0> .

Instagram ROAS

The ROI potential on Instagram is pretty sweet. In the three months since Instagram opened up its ad API, Facebook marketing partner Nanigans has seen more than 30% of its DR customers start to use the platform, with gaming and ecommerce as the most eager verticals. According to Nanigans, Instagram trumps Facebook when it comes to CPI and CTR. “Coupling the performance of their DR products with a large, active user base that’s continuing to grow, Instagram is on track to become a core DR channel in 2016,” Nanigans VP Cheryl Morris told AdExchanger. <http://go.adexchanger.com/TM0WF0P0B000DB620L4qAA0>  SocialTimes has more.

Prime Partner

Amazon is giving Prime subscribers access to new TV content from a single “billing and distribution hub,” writes Peter Kafka of Re/code. Through its Streaming Partners Program, Amazon is bulking up on video content through providers like Showtime, Starz and A+E Network. It may be an uphill battle, though, because TV networks, after getting burned by the likes of Netflix and Hulu, “aren’t letting Amazon resell their most valuable stuff.” <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLFW70APBN020qD40>  More on Re/code.  

Head In The Cloud

Cloud infrastructure services are the new platform powerplay. This is a trend that’s been coming on for some time, and Snapchat’s outage on Tuesday shows why. Snapchat is rumored to be Google App Engine’s biggest client, but it got burned when its disappearing messages failed to appear <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0B00FqO8>  all day, leading to lost revenue and user aggravation. It’s also a useful reminder of the immense data drain <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0BAAP0D9F00>  that video streaming puts on web networks. Just like with food, there’s a direct correlation between how much people enjoy something and how much strain it puts on the system.

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWz4BA00mL0PB0M2> Guardian CEO: Why Is It So Hard To Keep Gun Ads Off Our Site?
“The idea that in a programmatic world, we just have to get used to the fact that we never know what quite is going to appear in our most valuable places until it actually appears, doesn’t seem logical or acceptable,” Guardian US CEO Eamonn Store said.

News Round Up

P&G Earthquake

Largest US advertiser Procter & Gamble has finalized its first media-spending shift in almost 20 years, and it’s a doozy. Omnicom has taken  <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0B0TWD0L4Pt0A2q0z0BA00> over the majority of P&G’s budget (with Carat swiping a third and the incumbent, Starcom MediaVest, retaining some brands). Ad Age spoke to the company’s global brand chief, Marc Pritchard, who said losing consolidated buying power is less important than category-specific streamlining. “We will more frequently look at our agency lineup, particularly in media, given the rapid acceleration of capabilities in the digital world.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tu0Wz0P0B000DBU20L4qAA0> . Notably, the assignment will lead to the creation of a third media agency network at Omnicom, with P&G as the anchor client.

Everything Must Go

eBay’s recently spun off commerce and marketing platform, eBay Enterprise, keeps selling chunks of itself. Following the divestiture of its Clearsaleing attribution tech to Impact Radius (AdExchanger story <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00B0Vz0WvDP0L0A00> ), the company has offloaded its retargeting solution to London-based Ve Interactive. Read the announcement <http://go.adexchanger.com/GBB0Az20Dw4WW0AL0000P0q> . Terms of the deal were not disclosed. A source questions how much technology is left in the eBay Enterprise retargeting biz, after the company shifted those campaigns to Chango and eBay Audience Platform. Related: How Chango poached customers from its reseller partner eBay Enterprise <http://go.adexchanger.com/qBAW0A0DLx004z02B0PX00q> .

Who’d Buy Yahoo? (Cont.)

Are Yahoo’s media and ad tech holdings bound for carrier glory? Verizon would consider bidding on Yahoo, CMO Fran Shammo said at an investor conference on Monday.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PyDzA40LBB00YA> WaPo story. While we’re deep in speculative territory, such a move would bring about a scenario long discussed in Internet circles: a merger of AOL and Yahoo. No one expected that to happen under the umbrella of a telco giant, but the world turns in funny ways. Another big co lately mentioned as a possible buyer is SoftBank (which owns Sprint). Whither AT&T?

Environmental Concerns

A pessimistic take on the state of digital advertising at The New York Times dives into the struggles of online publishers, with DigitasLBi North America CEO Tony Weisman saying, “Ads are getting more pervasive and more difficult to easily get past.” But many are finally adapting (to mobile, HTML5 and user-first best practices). According to Times reporter Sydney Ember, “Ads have become so annoying, consumers and industry executives say, that they could sink the Internet if they were not also helping support it.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0zWD0Lz000B4000BZ> .

Ask Questions Later

Snapchat might be a black box for measurement, but that isn’t scaring off publishers. A parade <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DBBqA0020P0W0AAB00>  of media companies <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000C2040qABLPDBA10WA0>  have recently developed dedicated Snapchat teams. Now Mike Shields of The Wall Street Journal takes a look at Refinery29 <http://go.adexchanger.com/GBB0AA20DD42W0AL0000P0q> , which is doubling down on its content for the disappearing-message service. Media companies must produce continuously to remain on the high-profile Snapchat Discover page, but we’ll see if it pays back any new readers or if that money joins tablet-specific editions and pop-up ads on the island of misfit publisher initiatives.

Adobe is integrating more data management capabilities into its TV-planning system, Adobe Primetime. These capabilities let broadcasters change pricing around OTT and episodic TV inventory, depending on which audience an advertiser wants.

“The ease of managing the campaigns and the partnership with Steelhouse means it doesn’t make sense to use an agency, which would then use Steelhouse to run our campaigns,” online marketing director Krysta Brown said.

Header bidding is all the rage at the moment, and although it’s tempting to view it as just another fad, I believe it has important strategic implications. Header bidding finally puts the entire stack up for competition with multiple partners on equal footing.

News Round Up

In A Moment, Maybe

Twitter is asking top dollar from sponsors on its new Moments channel, which is a curated capsule of tweets, videos, photos and media surrounding a live event or news item, Digiday reports. It’s had some early adopters, including Starbucks, REI and Verizon, but there’s some hesitation as well. “$1 million was the price on the table. It was a bundled price — you had to buy the Moment as well as a Promoted Trend and media in Twitter,” said one top entertainment advertiser. “We haven’t done it yet as we need the price to come down.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0P1BuD000qA2w04L0B> .

Missed Connections

In an interview with Tim Peterson at Ad Age, GroupM digital chief Rob Norman reflects on Yahoo’s struggle to keep apace of (former) rivals. “Whilst I understand there are a bazillion Yahoo Mail accounts, I'm interested to know how many are active, how many are people's principal email accounts?” It’s a point not made often enough: Yahoo has survived on sheer volume and momentum (there are millions still on AOL dial-up, after all), but cross-device capabilities are the name of the game, and few keep Yahoo in their pocket. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00P2DwA40LBB00vA> .

Streaming Just Got Serious

Live video streaming has fizzled since Meerkat and Periscope broke out early this year, but it’s apparently heating back up again. Product Hunt just announced a deal with Blab <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02w0003w00BPW04DABAqL0>  for live video assistance, and Kanvas, AOL’s Periscope imitator, <http://go.adexchanger.com/T40Ww0P0B000DBx20L4qAA0>  onboarded its first brand. The most significant new entrant <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40y0A2w0B5LD0WBP00q0A0>  to the category is Facebook, which just released its live streaming product. Others have struggled to monetize, but Brian Fitzgerald points out at The Wall Street Journal why Facebook is uniquely positioned to leverage live streaming. “After a slow approach, Facebook’s news feeds are now filled with videos, including clips that automatically play. It’s been a gold mine.”

Popcorn!

Film studios have always been early adopters of new marketing channels. Snapchat, Twitch, Periscope and others can <http://go.adexchanger.com/Uq6P04A0LB0WAw02B0000zD>  testify <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB7000AwB0A200WL4qPA00> . Up next: messaging apps. Adweek’s Lauren Johnson reports on Disney/Pixar, Focus Features and Twentieth Century Fox’s efforts on messengers like Kik and Whisper. The goal, according to one entertainment marketing specialist, is content that has “a lot of social currency and can get passed along from one fan to another."

News Round Up

Ad Blocking’s Lost Boys

A team from Nieman Labs finds the growth of digital media makes it tough to measure the size of the ad blocking problem. Jim Coudal, CEO of the ad network The Deck, says that “if someone is using an adblocker, frankly, they’re not my user. I know how many ads I’m serving. That’s all I know, and the number of ads I’m serving in November has already surpassed (ads served in) October, September, and August.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0B0wWD0L4PX0A2q0q0BA00> .

Print’s Digital Renaissance

A few years ago, the San Francisco Chronicle was draining $50M per year from Hearst, its owner, and was being shopped to unimpressed buyers. Now the Chronicle is profitable and growing. So what gives? Well, Benjamin Mullen at Poynter identifies a new Hearst strategy of pairing content marketing agencies with regional papers, as it’s done in San Fran, Houston and NYC. “These marketing agencies represent Hearst’s entrée to big, sophisticated companies who want more than traditional advertising.” Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00qx0ALAWPYBB02q000> .

Stuck In Neutral

The New York Times covers the steady erosion of Yahoo’s market clout, chalking it up to the company’s decision to zig toward talent while most publisher innovation was zagging toward technology and data. GroupM’s Rob Norman summarizes the error with an ice cream reference. “[Yahoo] becomes vanilla in a land of not 32, but 5,032 flavors. … What Yahoo tried to do both with magazines and video was to be old media in the Internet age, and I suspect that that wasn’t the answer.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/uy0000DB4L0A0Z02qPqWAB0> More.

Pay To Play

A pair of WSJ reporters say YouTube has been in talks with Hollywood studios and production companies to secure TV and movie rights for its nascent YouTube Red subscription service. The service costs $10 per month, on par with Netflix, so it was tough to see at launch how Google planned to compete with the likes of Hulu, Amazon and Netflix, which offer a lot more than ad-free videos or some creator content.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lm32qADP0B00A0> Ancestry Drives Sales, Not Awareness Via Content Marketing
“It tends to be expensive [to work with publishers],” Ancestry head of content marketing Steve Dalton said. “Publishers want to do things on a CPM basis, and the way we run our program, CPM doesn’t work for us.”

Learning more about an app's user base will shed light on the sorts of incentives that are effective at encouraging re-engagement. The key is to know when precisely to offer such deals, which is where post-install app analytics data plays a huge role.

Bluecore is testing products across alternate channels, but the company’s current bread and butter (and meat and potatoes) is real-time email triggering. The company’s software enables automation for discounts and specific products based on online gift carts, wish lists and browsing, as well as supply chain concerns like out-of-stock statuses or inventory management.

While the trend toward in-house tech and services-laden vendors may have indicated to eBay that it was the right time to shrug off its third-party solutions in favor of its ecommerce market, attribution has quickly become a must-have for any vendors interested in differentiating their offering from what an enterprise brand is capable of.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/ub0000DB4L0A0y02mPqWAB0> Mobile Ad Fraud Matures On Android
APK fraud is growing in developing countries like India, in particular, mainly because the current obsession is on increasing user counts without an attendant focus on ROI and lifetime user value, said Deepak Abbot, head of mobile growth at Times Internet, the digital product arm of The Times of India Group, India’s largest media conglomerate.

News Round Up

Yahoo’s Future Suitors

In the wake of yesterday’s WSJ report <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lmc2zADP0B00A0>  that Yahoo’s board will consider selling off its core business (ad-supported digital media), the big question is, who would buy it? SoftBank, Time Inc., News Corp. and IAC are all floated as possible bidders in two follow-up WSJ stories. Read <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lmd2AADP0B00A0>  those <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PBDmA40LBB00eA> . Meanwhile Yahoo’s designated gadfly, Kara Swisher, suggests in Re/code that a more likely outcome “would be an outright purchase of Yahoo by a big telco looking for content and ad tech, much in the same way AOL was acquired by Verizon.”  

Publicis Shuffle

As part of a reorg at Publicis Groupe, Starcom MediaVest Group CEO Laura Desmond was promoted to chief revenue officer of the holding company and Steve King was placed in charge of all media agencies. More changes are detailed in the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqCP04A0LB0WAm02B0000fD> . CEO Maurice Levy said the move was motivated by the rise of digital technology and declared silos the enemy of progress. "All Publicis Group capabilities will be available to each of our clients in a simple, flexible and efficient way," he said in a YouTube video. Watch it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/FBDBL00gD0W0P2mq000AA04> 

For SEO, Now You Know

Google recently released a 160-page guide <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40h0A2m0BELD0WBP00q0A0>  detailing how its algorithm ranks landing pages for quality. According to Marc Purtell, a specialist writing for Search Engine Journal, it is “the largest official release of information pertaining to Google’s algorithm in a single collection.” Purtell noted that SEO vendors seem to have, if anything, underestimated the extent of Google’s vigilance. Its algorithm will take into account details like in-page links to trustworthy, relevant resources, and will require far more frequent attention to stay apace of mobile site quality expectations.

IPO: Four-Letter Word?

The cloud storage company Box, which went public in 2014, has gotten lapped by private competitors like DropBox … but why is a VC valuation better than a stock market valuation, other than the fact that it’s easier to inflate? Farhad Manjoo at The New York Times questions the VC-funded tech world’s frosty relationship with the the public market, which bestows secondary advantages like employee stability, cashable stock options and a benchmarking for competitive valuations (it also pays out investors).

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/GBB0Aj20Dm42W0AL0000P0q> Next Stop For Network-Level Ad Blocking: The US?
O2 hasn’t made an official decision one way or the other, but a spokesperson from the carrier told AdExchanger that although O2 believes in a “predominantly ad-funded Internet, we see ad blocking as a call to the industry to raise the bar in terms of the quality of the advertising it delivers.”

Ephemerally communicating what you’re doing or how you’re feeling is a powerful new type of peer-to-peer marketing. Different than Facebook or Instagram, which are mostly many-to-many.

News Round Up

Pay Attention

The Economist and Financial Times have both introduced metrics that charge advertisers based on “temporal activity” (aka time on page, though it may sound like a brain function). Speaking with Mediapost’s Joe Mandese, several media agency execs throw their weight behind the new engagement stats. Audrey Siegel of Assembly says, “Everyone is struggling with what have been relatively blunt evaluations ... to develop and analyze various media.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4j0v0P00qD002LBW0bAB> .

Google’s ‘First Look’ Cometh

Google’s response to header bidding, First Look, is in active beta and accepting publisher partners to test the product. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Ljc2wADP0B00A0> , director of product management Jonathan Bellack officially announced the pilot, which AdExchanger wrote about <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0B00jqxd>  a few weeks ago. He said early results showed a 10% lift in yield. Header bidding cropped up in part because the DFP ad server didn’t allow publishers to put every impression up for sale, so the move is Goliath’s first strike back against David.

Back To School

Programmatic expertise has bubbled up through advertising, tech and media, and now it’s working its way into the ivory tower of college campuses. Digiday’s Shareen Pathak cites former Criteo President Greg Coleman and former NBC ad sales SVP Nick Johnson, who both teach digital media courses. Pathak follows Undertone founder Eric Franchi (who had himself a good day <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPBa4B00W000qAj0020AuD> ) to a guest lecture at a Fordham class taught by Rubicon Project vet Ed Carey. Carey says students are pushing for expertise in SSPs, DSPs, DMPs, etc., but “there aren’t a lot of tenured professors who can actually teach it as a subject matter expert.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBy000AjB0A200WL4qPe00> .  

“A” Is For Broadband

Of the nine named subsidiaries within Alphabet (including Google), the most nebulous and interconnected is Access, the company’s push into broadband services, which encompasses Google Fiber. “From the little figures we can grok on Fiber, it may be a bigger concern now for telcos than the pay TV business,” says Re/code reporter Mark Bergen. We don’t really know what’s going on inside Access, or its expensive subsidiary Fiber (which is expected to eat up $2B next year), but we do know AT&T and Comcast are watching very closely <http://go.adexchanger.com/yBjWDqP00A0LABf04z00020> .

Industry Preview, January 20-21, Grand Hyatt New York <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PNB00000Af4Dq02BWx0>  -  On Day 1 at 2:20 p.m., Forrester Research analyst Tina Moffett looks at the growing need to address marketing’s impact across the myriad of consumer touchpoints available today with her new research, “Measurement and Unified Marketing Impact Analytics (UMIA). See agenda <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0POByD000qA2f04L0B> . Sponsored by DataXu, Inneractive and Integral Ad Science

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqPB0B2LW004D0P0AAz0f00> Verified Traffic Doesn’t Necessarily Mean Bot-Free Traffic
Bot operators aren’t looking to pass the Turing test or create artificial intelligence. They’re looking to fool people for a period of time and siphon as much cash as possible within that window before their bots are found out.

Marketers should ask vendors how and what they are matching. How do the numerator and denominator relate to each other? How does this specific match rate percentage correspond to the total universe of consumers they want to reach?

News Round Up

What Social Bounce?

Ecommerce isn’t the same landscape for everyone. Mike Shields reports for The Wall Street Journal that a specific breed of aspirational, lifestyle  <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000X2040qABLPDBfH0WA0> retailers, such as trendy home decor or wedding-centric outlets, are driving massive shares of their traffic via Pinterest. But for the 10,000 largest retailers, on average only 4% of all traffic comes via social media. Social media companies are fighting to become important pit stops in the digital shopping funnel, but it’s not so easy. Related: Social buy buttons and direct commerce on social media have largely been a dud <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0B00fqYI> .

Old Guard, New Strategy

Nokia’s fall from grace is a well-known cautionary tale: The one-time mobile superpower got smoked by Apple and Samsung before selling off its assets to Microsoft and BMW. NYT tech editor Pui-Wing Tam says Nokia’s current attempt to re-establish itself as a telco player via a $16.6B takeover of Alcatel-Lucent “is a reminder of how fickle and fast-moving the tech world can be. In the waning days of 2015, it’s up to the old guard to keep up.” Desktop display ad titans, take note! Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/BB00ZW2A000040fB0DJLPqA> on.

Another Day, Another ‘Platisher’

The Financial Times launched a quasi-editorial, quasi-marketing initiative with Google Maps, which layers reviews, articles, writers’ opinions and more onto locations across London. The eventual goal is to include audio and video features. The FT said the new touchpoint will elevate its contributor network and broaden the pub’s appeal, as it continues to rebrand to a more city-focused audience over just political and financial news. It also highlights Google’s commitment to leveraging its properties on behalf of publishers (such as a recent Google Cardboard VR project <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PB000q2K0f>  with The New York Times).

Cashing In

In the US, consumer adoption of mobile payment tech is plodding along. In China, however, “a fierce battle” is underway between the messenger app WeChat and Alipay, the digital wallet subsidiary of ecommerce titan Alibaba. It’s unclear whether Chinese trends can be transplanted in the US, where laptops and Google have a little bit of traction, to say the least. But as Tom Griffiths points out in Ad Age, “The total spend of China's outbound tourists reached $498 billion in 2014,” so piggybacking on those budgets alone makes the Chinese platforms a global force.
