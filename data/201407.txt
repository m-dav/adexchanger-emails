 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Embracing Automation

More than 98% of online publishers in the US are taking a data-driven, programmatic approach to audience engagement, according to a new Winterberry Group report released on Wednesday. For the study, Winterberry Group partnered with the IAB to survey more than 200 marketers across the globe. Abroad, the percentage of publishers pushing for automation is less impressive, at around 75%. The report goes on to rank publishers around the world in five key segments: programmatic comprehension, transparency, access to data, access to technology and standard metrics. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P04070DEA7q2> . And download the report <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q07A0DB0W12Lq007A00F4P0> .

Risky Business

Forbes Chief Insights Officer Bruce Rogers called native advertising "incredibly controversial” during a panel discussion at the Association of Data Driven Marketing and Advertising in Australia on Tuesday. Without clearly marked native content, he said, publishers risk "denigrating the brand." As Forbes and other premium publishers continue to weave sponsored content into their pages, Rogers said carefully curating partners and labeling their contributions is key.

More Programmatic Funds

Programmatic ad platform Dstillery (née Media6Degrees) announced that it has raised an additional $24 million in venture capital ($48 million total) and promises to innovate with cross-device targeting in mind. In addition, the company gave a wee window into their momentum: “Revenue in the first half of 2014 was up 50 percent from the prior year, while staff grew by 40 percent. Dstillery was recently selected as a premier partner by both Twitter and LinkedIn.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/G7B0A720DH43W0AL0000P0q> .

Palantir Buys Poptip

Palantir, a large-scale data mining company whose clients include the FBI and the CIA, acquired startup Poptip on Wednesday. Poptip specializes in analyzing data from Twitter, taking unstructured data and producing statistics that help brands track trending conversations and target key audiences. The news of the acquisition surfaced on Tuesday, in a Poptip company blogpost <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0070670WKDP0L0A00> , and pricing and terms of the deal have not yet been disclosed. Palantir, founded in 2004, has raised $900 million to date and its software was purportedly used to locate Osama bin Laden. But what would such a high-level data mining company such as this want with Poptip's Twitter expertise? Maybe social data is more valuable than we thought.

Paper Not PowerPoint

"Too many of our sales calls end up with both parties simply falling into their assigned roles," observes Doug Weaver in this week's installment of The Drift. "Both the seller and buyer know they have to have a certain number of meetings, and they end up in the business equivalent of a bad blind date." Ditch the snooze-worthy PowerPoint, advises Weaver. "If you’re seeking a real, genuine conversation, then a piece of paper with some observations about the account is a better bet." Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000072870L0B0MA4PDAq> .

R.I.P. Facebook Gifts

Facebook is ditching its gift services, the company announced Tuesday, in a pivot to fully embrace its shiny new “buy” button. Facebook Gifts was awkward at best: "It's so-and-so's birthday, your second cousin's best friend, send them a gift card!" However random, Facebook learned a lot from its Gifts program, which launched in 2012. The company will funnel those consumer insights into its other marketing ventures (Autofill With Facebook, Custom Audiences, Offline Sales Measurement).

Global Gaming 

On Wednesday, Chartboost struck a partnership with mobile gaming company Chukong Technologies to expand global monetization for developers. San Francisco-based Chartboost offers a revenue platform for mobile games, and Beijing’s Chukong is among China's largest mobile entertainment companies. The partnership is a nod to China's growing mobile market, which is projected to hit a $3 billion valuation by year's end. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP07007qPb> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Ads Against Pirates

A new initiative in the UK is repurposing digital display ads for an innovative take on cyber law enforcement, according to TechCrunch. Dubbed “Operation Creative,” and managed by the City of London's Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, the initiative targets websites that illegally stream pirated or copyright infringing material, replacing banner ads on those pages with a hard-edged warning from law officials. "This website had been reported to the police," the banner ads read. "Please close the browser page containing this website." For the time being, these spots will appear exclusively in the UK.

Russian Display

Although Russian search provider Yandex beat out estimated earnings and revenue, display advertising suffered in 2014's second quarter. Down 6% from Q2 in 2013, Yandex attributed the decline to less revenue generated from company-owned websites. However, during the earnings call Tuesday morning, Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh was optimistic about the profits driven by advertising overall. "Our core text-based advertising business drove strong financial results with solid growth in advertisers and paid clicks," Volozh told investors. "The acquisition of Auto.ru, announced earlier this month, is a strong move into classifieds which is one of the fastest growing segments of online advertising..."

Social Metrics Mature

Social media metrics are evolving, writes Digiday's John McDermott. Graduating from "likes" and "followers," marketers are turning instead to purchase intent, click-throughs, sales and brand lift,  in search of hard social metrics. “Likes and followers, that’s kind of the thing of the past,” said MRY CEO Matt Britton. “Its value is diminished, and brand marketers are having a hard time connecting it with their business metrics.” The shift is not exclusive to Facebook, Britton added, decreasing organic reach on Twitters is also causing a rift in the social metrics matrix.

Tactical Training

In an attempt to stay one step ahead of industry trends, The Drum says that MediaCom and Google are partnering for global staff training on wearables and mobile marketing. The training program might preempt the cementing of the wearable tech biz, but it bolsters training in the now-established mobile arena. "Mobile is becoming more pervasive in digital disciplines,” said Ben Phillips, global head of mobile for MediaCom. “It's important to have an educated perspective on the benefits and how to integrate mobile into an overall media plan. Wearable technology will be part of the training process, while we focus on the foundations of mobile advertising, search and analytics...” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLP7h4B00W000qA20020AQD> .

Retargeting Redux

A recent study by AdRoll drills down into Facebook retargeting, and unearths some useful stats for those marketers keeping a close eye on mobile marketing. According to AdRoll's findings, CPM pricing for in-feed ad impressions is 57% less expensive than in-feed impressions on desktop. In addition to being less expensive, in-feed ads impressions on mobile drive a 10% higher CTR than those on desktop. Who would have thought?

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Chatvertising

A new wave of advertising may be upon us in the form of chat bots, writes WSJ tech columnist Christopher Mims. Services like WhatsApp and Facebook have been popular for quite some time, but new chat apps are cropping up, designed with brand engagement in mind. Kik is one such service, most popular among teens in the US. Four in 10 American teenagers are active on Kik, and these users are already "chatvertising" with a handful of brands like Moviefone and Funny or Die. "This is what native advertising in chat apps looks like," writes Mims. "And chat apps, we keep hearing, are the future of social media. Mark Zuckerberg, are you listening?" Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWd400F0ABD00W06L02P0Aq> .

Threading In Ads

The NY Times reports that, for the first time since its inception nine years ago, Reddit is looking to kick-start its advertising business. Reddit officials declined to share specifics on their ad strategy but, according to NYT sources, “a large campaign” will cost advertisers about $100,000 and a single ad sale should go for $20,000. “People on Reddit want to be anonymous, and at some point these brands want to have a real relationship with their customers,” Gartner Research Internet analyst Brian Blau offered. The question: “Can Reddit deliver that over time?” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqGB062LW004D0P0AAe0W00> . Lots of uniques doesn’t necessarily mean a lot of $$$.

Exchange Access

Google, which wasn’t part of the initial creation of open standards for RTB bidding in 2010 known as  <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00Wf0ALAWPH6B02q000> OpenRTB, has joined the club. On the Google Ads Developer blog, DoubleClick’s Mark Saniscalchi announces his company’s development of two OpenRTB libraries, including “the openrtb-doubleclick library [which] is an extension of openrtb for DoubleClick Ad Exchange that provides interoperability between the OpenRTB model andDoubleClick's Real-Time Bidding protocol <http://go.adexchanger.com/B600IW2A000040WB0DgLPqA> .” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/TJ0WW0P06000DBh20L4qAA0> .

The Twitter Vs. The Facebook

Ad Age looks at why some believe Twitter’s chances for success shouldn’t be judged apples-to-apples with Facebook, which has several hundred million more unique users. Ad Age’s Mark Bergen reports, “Next to Facebook, [Twitter] is a superior conversational medium, and so, a better space for real-time marketing, several marketers claimed. It is morphing into a media portal, where people turn for news and to explore their interests. And it is beefing up its tools for targeting these consumers, including its Tailored Audiences program and Crashalytics, its mobile-app dashboard.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L06qW0D00KAiB0W4PA> .

In-Store Alerts

Hudson's Bay is debuting a mobile ad strategy that sends messages to in-store shoppers while they browse. The retail giant is working with tech company Swirl to identify consumers via beacons, and will send location-based messages to consumers beginning with a handful of Bay and Lord & Taylor stores in the US and Canada. Only those shoppers who've downloaded the Bay's mobile application or the coupon app Snip Snap will receive the in-store alerts. This mobile-first step is but one leg of Hudson' Bay’s increasingly digital strategy, and the retail giant will purportedly <http://go.adexchanger.com/F6DBL00jL0W0P2Wq000AA04>  spend $40 million this year on digital advertising.

Ditching Last Click

Writing for The Next Web, Struq CEO and co-founder Sam Barnett pens an anti-last-click manifesto for the multidevice epoch. "The last click attribution model has always been flawed,” he writes. "It attempts to simplify complex conversion paths on a last come first served basis, and allows advertisers to ignore the vast amount of data available to them." Advertisers should instead embrace a move away from traditional attribution models, says Barnett, and focus on incremental campaign performance.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

More Video Ad Inventory

Google is buying Twitch <http://go.adexchanger.com/B600zW2A000040SB0DbLPqA>  for $1 billion, VentureBeat first reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DcA02000BWS0q46ALP0A>  on Thursday. Twitch is an aggregation site for streaming video games in real time (think YouTube for serious gaming enthusiasts), where users can broadcast their desktop, Xbox One or PlayStation 4 sessions to online viewers. A quick visit to Twitch will either confuse or thrill you, depending on your interests. But the site is clearly ad-heavy already, and could be a major platform for Google’s programmatic video ad strategy. The San Francisco-based startup hosts more than 50 million monthly users, and the company has raised about $35 million to date. The terms of the deal and official purchase price were not disclosed. The acquisition further expands Google’s video ad inventory beyond YouTube.

More On Margins

Advertisers are increasingly concerned with the tight-lipped practices of their agency trading desks, says an article in The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ points to  the programmatic exchange space, where it says advertisers want to know where their money is going and if agency holding companies are making a profit in the margins. Xaxis is vocal about the profits it makes, but Omnicom’s admission to marking up media during Tuesday’s earnings call caused a bit of a stir. The devil in in the details here, as each holding company looks to align itself on one side of the media markup line or the other (or avoid the question altogether). The Association of National Advertisers (ANA) says it's on marketers to seek clarity from their agencies on how their ad spend is being managed. Read more via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/G6B0AS20DB4dW0AL0000P0q> . For its marketer members, the ANA released a white paper on agency trading desks in 2011 <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLP6e4B00W000qAS0020ACD> .

Matching Metrics

Tracking click-through rates is an imperfect way to measure digital campaigns, writes SimpleReach CEO Edward Kim for Digiday. But, he writes, "Let's avoid letting 'engagement time' become the new metric of choice.” With the rise of native advertising and an increasingly complex digital ad landscape, Kim says metrics should always be goal-specific. "If an e-commerce brand is using content to drive sales or subscription sign-ups, then neither time nor sharing should be the key metric," he writes. "Instead, the brand should focus on the only metric that really matters: conversions.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/I060fWD0L4PD0A2q0S0BA00> .

Orange Sells Ad Network

Unanimis, which was a wholly owned UK-based ad network <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0gS6WPE0A00>  of Orange France Telecom Group, has sold itself to Switch, according to ExchangeWire’s Ronan Shields. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/lSBqF000L6DP0A2A4000h0W> . On Unanimis’ website, CEO Tom Barnett of ad server company Switch says in a release, “The acquisition will enable both entities to build on their strengths. .. The winning combination of Switch’s innovative technology and Unanimis’ top agency trading relationships should deliver excellent growth for the company.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0SWD0LG000B40006i> . MediaTel reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00SA0L0Dj006B2qW0AHP04>  that Orange UK mobile inventory will still be available through Unanimis. Reading the telecom tea leaves: SingTel is buying <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0IL0000SP02BAqD60k40A> ad networks <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000J2040qA6LPDBSl0WA0> . Orange is selling them. What gives? AppNexus made a deal <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0mS0L60DB0K0W0q4P20A0A>  with Orange in 2012 to power Orange’s European ad exchange.

Native’s Bad Rap

A recent IAB study on industry perceptions of native advertising is one of the largest to date, according to ZDNet. TripleLift sponsored the study, titled "Getting Sponsored Content Right: The Consumer View <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PLB00000AS4Dq026Wn0> ," which surveyed 5,000 consumers of online news on the effectiveness of native advertising in general, business and entertainment news. Perhaps unsurprisingly, results showed big benefits for brands but potential risks for publishers. Sixty-two percent of respondents said native content does nothing to enhance a publisher's reputation. At stake is credibility. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/B600MW2A000040SB0DoLPqA> .

Programmatic Game Plan

Writing for Forbes, Simulmedia CMO David Cooperstein makes a case for programmatic best practices. Cooperstein calls programmatic "the best game in town for managing ad prices," but also alludes to inherent placement problems. Successful programmatic marketing, he says, is contingent on transparency in pricing, inventory, insertion and data. Automated processes and buy-side tools are firmly established in search advertising and have a strong footing in display, according Cooperstein, and next up is digital video and TV. “But it will take time to see programmatic become the de facto buying process across all media types,” he adds.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

LinkedIn Endorses Native

LinkedIn is growing its native ad strategy, with a new option for brands to personalize and test news feed content. LinkedIn's calling it "Direct Sponsored Content," and the offering aims to help brands improve the relevancy of their content. Brands can now bypass posting promotional content to company pages, and can publish the ads directly to the LinkedIn news feed. Also noteworthy, brands specify audience segments in order to send personalized in-feed messages. Read the post <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W06sA0q090BAL0PDN2> .

Not So Fast, In-Feed Native

As if on cue following LinkedIn’s “Direct Sponsored Content” update, Yahoo Studio Director Krane Jeffery warned advertisers about confusing the line between in-feed content and native ads. ”In-feed isn’t the same as native,” said Jeffery at the IAB conference in London. “While it might be an effective means for companies to engage with a person, to confuse it with native doesn’t help anybody. Even if you argue that an ad is well targeted, relevant to consumers experience and looks like the surrounding content, you certainly can’t argue that it’s not interruptive.” Read more via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0at02q0L0AB0D600AN4> .

Location’s So Last Season

WPP mobile executive Michael Lieberman spoke to Street Fight mag last week at the Place conference in NYC, and what he had to say about location data might [not] surprise you. Lieberman is chief executive NA at Joule, WPP's global mobile practice. For ad tech in mobile, "Location is already not special,” said Lieberman. “Among the companies that are offering [solutions], very few actually have a technology that is differentiated." Instead, Lieberman sees a different opportunity for marketers. “You’re going to see a lot of focus on at-retail budgets,” he projected. “Which has been ignored for over a decade. No one has brought the people who run a store any innovation outside of POS in a long time. I do think there’s missed opportunity there.”  Read the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DbA02000BWN0q46uLP0A> .

Silent Trackers

Mobile advertising startup SilverPush is taking a markedly different approaching to cross-device ad targeting. According to CEO Hitesh Chawla, who spoke to TechCrunch, the company uses what it calls "ultrasonic inaudible sounds" to track consumers and retarget them across multiple devices. An "ultrasonic inaudible sound" is basically a cookie disguised as an audio beacon. When a user surfs the web page, SilverPush can drop the audio beacon on that browser. The browser won't hear a thing, but the audio device can be used to match browsing behaviors across devices. Chawla acknowledged the “dis” of negative public perception associated with tracking of this caliber. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LNc2vADP0600A0> .

Omnicom-Publicis Bennies

MDC Partners reported the strongest quarter in the company’s history on Thursday afternoon, according to Chairman and CEO Miles S. Nadal. Audibly thrilled, Nadal reported a 10.5% increase in revenue, up to $317.7 million from $287.5 million, with organic revenue increasing 7.0%. Interestingly, Nadal attributed some portion of the company’s recent growth to the failed Omnicom-Publicis merger. “We have been a very large beneficiary of both the proposed merger and now the failed merger,” Nadal told investors during the call. “We’ve benefited in three ways. One, we’re picking up talent at an accelerated rate from both of those organizations. We’re also winning significant amounts of new business. The third thing is that during the period that which they were preoccupied, there was no real competition for M&A.” Read the earnings report <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02d000wN006PW04DABAqL0> .

Programmatic OOH

On a quarterly earnings call with analysts, CEO Richard Bressler of out-of-home (OOH) media company CC Media said his company was getting into programmatic buying with the recent hire of Brian Lakamp, the company’s new president of technology and digital ventures. Bressler said that Lakamp will lead development of his company’s tech platform and will “also be responsible for developing our company's overall strategy and execution related to technology, big data and programmatic buying among other things.” Read the transcript on Seeking Alpha <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLNWf0AP6y020qD40> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Amazon Automates

Amazon debuted a self-serve ad-buying tool on Wednesday, and VivaKi is the first in training to trial the offering (although the Publicis-owned agency has yet to run a campaign). Amazon plans to extend the tool to "select" agencies, but for the time being it only has eyes for VivaKi. Amazon exec Seth Dallaire tells Ad Age, "We chose them as the launch partner for this exercise because we recognize they have a lot of experience in the programmatic media space.” Both Amazon and VivaKi declined to comment on a definitive timeline for extending the offering or launching the first campaign.

P&G Supply Hooks

AudienceScience has released a supply-side API to give its advertisers direct access to a wider set of digital inventory. Initial partners include LiveRail, AOL’s Marketplace SSP, and sovrn (née Federated Media). There’s no mention of P&G in the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/F6DBL00Q40W0P2Iq000AA04> , but the subtext here could be the world’s largest advertiser – widely known as a big client for AudienceScience – is casting a wider net in programmatic media. That would jibe with reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/jq5B062LW004D0P0AAR0I00>  that P&G plans to automate up to 75% of display ad spend by the end of this year.

Programmatic Consolidation

Media business management software company WideOrbit <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02S0006I006PW04DABAqL0>  acquired Admeta <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00TWqA0006PIA07040D2L>  on Wednesday, the third company WideOrbit has bought in the last three months. Headquartered in Sweden, Admeta offers a programmatic sell-side platform and works with clients such as Alma Media, Prisa Digital, Grupa Onet, Agora and MKT Media. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/y6IWDqP00A0LABU04800020> .

Partnering For Coupons

RichRelevance and Tapad forged a partnership on Wednesday geared towards deepening retail advertising engagement. Founded by a former Amazon exec, Dave Selinger, RichRelevance’s Shopping Media tool helps customers find promotions, offers and discounts in real time. Through the partnership, Tapad will help Shopping Media brands connect to consumers across devices. Unification is the name of the game!

For the first time in four years of analyzing mobile app marketing competition and costs,Fiksu reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4I0a0P00qD002LBW0WA6>  that its cost-per-loyal-user index surpassed $2 in June, coming in at $2.23, a 25% increase from May and a 49% increase YoY. While Cost Per Loyal User rose, June’s cost per install decreased by 23% from May, hitting $0.98 on iOS. Frequently, these two metrics move in the same direction, but because of summer consumer behavior of opting for activities beyond smart phones, accentuated by the World Cup, they moved in opposite directions – says Fiksu.

StrongView, which is featured in the report, is giving away a copy here <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W06cA0q0Y0BAL0PDI2> .

Yahoo’s Flurry

"Gartner analyst Mike McGuire chimes in on Yahoo’s acquisition of Flurry via his company’s blog.  Though he sees opportunity for marketers created by the purchase, he warns, “If you’re a mobile marketing exec who has made an investment in Flurry, keep the clear lenses in your glasses, because a lot of folks will be offering you rose-colored ones. Yahoo’s global scale is undeniable, and that bodes well for Flurry. But Yahoo’s uneven history with acquisitions is just as undeniable.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00ZWqA0006PIA0d040D2L> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Automating Reserved

On Tuesday AOL UK announced that “all reserved inventory” is available programmatically across its owned and operated sites available –through AOL's demand-side platform. This includes The Huffington Post, Engadget, Parentdish and more. AOL UK's managing director, Noel Penzer, said the decision reaffirmed the company's commitment to automation and signaled AOL UK's belief that programmatic advertising will continue to drive digital budgets. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLP6d4B00W000qAE0020AnD> . As tech gets commoditized industrywide, having exclusive access to inventory may be an increasingly important consideration in choosing an ad or marketing tech stack.

Measuring Native

SimpleReach announced on Tuesday that it had raised $9 million, which the startup will use to expand its measurement capabilities. The company offers content marketing and native ad measurement, working with clients such as The New York Times, Forbes, The Huffington Post and The Atlantic. SimpleReach measures content performance for its publisher clients and predicts how much social media traffic each article will drive by scoring each feature. Publishers can then choose to promote its strongest content through ad spots on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Outbrain, Nativo, StumbleUpon and TripleLift.

Nuanced Mobile Targeting

Facebook announced new tools on Tuesday that expand precise targeting abilities for mobile app ads, which now let marketers reach audiences on specific mobile device models. "For example," Facebook explained in a blog post, "you can deliver ads to people specifically using a Google Nexus 10 with a minimum OS version of 3.0, who are on Wi-Fi. Previously you could only target iOS or Android, minimum OS version and Wi-Fi only users." Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBp000AE60A200WL4qPf00> .

Facing The Music

Google will face a privacy lawsuit head-on after a federal judge rejected the company's bid to dismiss the case on Tuesday. The lawsuit dates back to March, when Google created a unified privacy policy that allowed the company to merge data across Gmail, Google Maps and YouTube products. Users across Google-owned platforms complained that the changes were made without their consent and that they weren’t offered a chance to opt out. At stake, users say, is the threat of third-party identity theft through the exposure of names, email addresses and geographic locations. Re/code has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWE46A00qL0PB0g2> .

Investing (More) In Mobile

Advertisers will spend more on smartphones and tablets this year than on newspapers and radio, according to eMarketer estimates. Mobile ad spend will grow 83% to reach $18 billion by the end of the year, although considering the amount of time Americans spend on devices analyst say mobile ad spend could be much higher. "The location capabilities inherent in mobile are a big factor driving a lot of ad revenue into the mobile space," said Angela Steele, CEO for the IPG-owned mobile marketing firm Ansible Mobile.

Axing The Check In

"The superfluous "just checking in" email is the kiss of death for sellers, says seller domo Doug Weaver in this week's edition of The Drift. Followups of this kind aren't likely to advance a sale, he argues, adding, “It’s a tough habit to break, but nothing could be more destructive to the rep’s reputation and perceived value.” Instead, Weaver suggest that sellers establish a deadline in their original pitch and invite the buyer to decline the offer.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Verizon’s Tracking Tradeoff

Verizon made headlines on Monday with promises to upgrade upload speeds, but also announced an interesting development for advertisers. The company is launching a rewards program centered on tracking data, through which Verizon subscribers can earn points for every dollar spent on wireless services, also applicable to device upgrades. What's in it for Verizon? Subscribers will have to consent to releasing their location data, which is valuable information for marketers looking to serve targeted ads. Read more at the News  <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0600xqSP> & Observer. This is reminiscent of business models such as Enliken’s <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWx46A00TL0PB0Q2> .

Pure Loyalty

Purell is among a handful of CPG brands who are betting on loyalty programs, a mainstay for travel brands and retailers but a rarity for consumer packaged goods. Through its new “Be Well Network,” Purell is looking to expand the limited amount of consumer data the company has pooled to date. So far, Purell has relied on data such as consumer purchasing habits and attitudinal studies. But according to Kathleen Leigh, marketing director for Purell Consumer commerce, that's not enough.

BuzzFeed’s Social Referrals

While some publishers have largely ignored Pinterest as a platform to drive content traffic, BuzzFeed is apparently seeing some tangible results. The company began producing content specifically for sharing on Pinterest two years ago, and the social scrapbooking site has now become BuzzFeed's second biggest source of social referrals (bumping Twitter down a peg). "Of course, Pinterest and Twitter are very different animals," writes Forbes' Jeff Bercovici, "so there’s no reason to treat the competition as a zero sum one — except in some ways it is." Markets might soon see the site as a window of opportunity. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0600xqVS> .

Marker Seeking Multichannel

Email has long been the most effective channel for lead nurturing but according to a new study by Bizo and Oracle, B2B marketers may be seeking (Bizo and Oracle likely hope so) a more multichannel approach. Adding automation to the email mix might help expand lead nurturing. Seventy-two percent of the 505 marketers surveyed already use an automation platform for email marketing, and 82% will either maintain or increase investments in these platforms by the end of the year. Read on at Direct Marketing News <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B06AAW0DTx00> .

Fingerprinting

Referencing work <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0UX02q0L0AB0D600Ax4>  from university researchers in the United States and Belgium, ProPublica’s Julia Angwin identifies AddThis, German digital marketer Ligatus and dating site Plentyoffish as companies using “canvas fingerprinting” technology which attempts to track users across devices. Responding to concerns about consumer privacy, AddThis CEO Rich Harris tells Angwin his “company has only used the data collected from canvas fingerprints for internal research and development. The company won’t use the data for ad targeting or personalization if users install the AddThis opt-out cookie on their computers.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L06qW0D00YAVB0x4PA> .

Retargeting Travel Funding

"Targeting the travel industry, Intent Media announced yesterday it had received another round of funding to the tune of $22.7 million (in total, $50 million+ according to Crunchbase <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40X0A2x0B0LD0W6P00q0A0> ). Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP6Y0xq0AD00B41020W0>  which includes this boilerplate: “Intent Media's data-driven advertising products help to unlock the revenue potential of online travel companies while safeguarding their core transaction businesses.” Adara Media <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0Zx6WP20A00>  and Sojern <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4y040P00qD002LBW00A6>  are among several companies “travelling” in Intent Media’s competitive set.

Banana Audiences

"On Monday, Facebook released a case study detailing how Banana Republic used Custom Audiences to increase both reach and ROAS, and target younger demographics. The results proved 4x higher returns on ad spend compared to other display advertising channels, and 60% higher click-through rates with Facebook's lookalike models compared to other display media.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

More Native

LinkedIn is coming out of stealth with a new take on native, and Mercedes is behind the wheel to test drive what is described as a new ad format. On Thursday, Mercedes introduced a contest via the professional networking website: “Unlike typical giveaways, users will not enter the contest on their own behalf, but rather will nominate someone in their LinkedIn network.” Read more via The New York Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D6BqA0020P0WYAsW00> . Success metrics for the campaign are unclear.

Video Storytelling

VentureBeat vetted some input from two anonymous Facebook employees, who spoke openly about the company's swerve towards video advertising. "Video is where it’s going,” said one source, purportedly a Facebook advertising executive. “With unique profile IDs, you have the ability to better sequentially target content for users as they embark on their journey through the social media funnel.” “Sequential content delivery in ads sends a top-level message to consumers that brands know who they are," said another source. "The reach and frequency of video ads allows Facebook the ability to reach out to users more effectively. Video is very powerful, and Facebook is committed to that pipeline of direct response.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0600sqXZ> .

As The Publisher Turns

Forbes Media announced on Friday plans to sell a majority stake of the company to a consortium of Hong Kong investors. The deal follows a nine-month-long sales process. "The Web has smashed all the boundaries of traditional media. Everyone is scrambling," Steve Forbes told Digiday. "We think the possibilities are very real in media, but what we did today also lets us do brand extensions to areas like tech, real-estate, and financial services," he said, adding, "Just pining for the good old days is not the way to move ahead in the new days.

Post-Kick Rebrand

On the heels of its somewhat ignominious fall-out with Facebook over violating certain of the social network’s data collection policies, mobile attribution startup HasOffers is rebranding itself as Tune, which will now act as a parent company for HasOffers.com and MobileAppTracking.com. Back in February, HasOffers was kicked out <http://go.adexchanger.com/i0tW00B6P1L00A000Dq2A04>  of Facebook’s Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP) program for, among other things, giving its customers access to device-level performance and attribution data. Mobile analytics firm Kontagent, which ended up on Facebook’s MMP blacklist for similar reasons, changed its name to Upsight back in March.

Upfronts Down

A handful of advertisers are shying away from cable TV ad spend, according to The Wall Street Journal. With dollars dwindling in this year's upfronts, companies such as GM, P&G and others may contribute to the first upfront ad decline on record since the recession.

Television's Changing Tides

"Programmatic TV advertising as a long-term strategy is being evaluated by all of the major TV media owners and media agency TV buyers," reports Ad Age's Dave Morgan. "And audience-based TV ad buying, while nascent, is now being tested by virtually every TV media owner and TV ad buyer." Morgan says three factors are responsible for the shift: audience fragmentation, a lack of accountability tied to ROI and an appetite for digital offerings. Of course, change won't happen overnight. Addressable, programmatic and audience-based strategies could hit the industry in waves. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/G6B0At20D445W0AL0000P0q> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Path-To-Purchase Patent

AOL’s Adap.tv recieved a patent for TV conversion tracking, which the company claims will help advertisers glean if TV spots are sending people to the Internet, to mobile or to stores to make purchases. “Online advertising systems have a problem with over-attribution. They tend to be very good at taking credit for – well – everything! TV has the opposite problem; TV tends to take no credit at all.”  Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L06qW0D00vAIB0h4PA> .

Native Ghetto

Writing for WSJ, Mike Shields wonders if the rise in direct response-oriented native ads on Yahoo may have contributed to the “unfavorable mix shift” CEO Marissa Mayer cited in the company’s Q2 earnings, reported Tuesday <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L06qW0D00wAJB0h4PA> . “Native ads until now have been billed as premium spots. But judging from the ads on the Yahoo homepage – which features plenty of direct response – some of the most valuable real estate in online advertising has lost some of its luster.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqxB062LW004D0P0AAK0h00> 

eBay Adds Mobile Ads

CEO John Donahoe hinted on eBay’s Q2 earnings call that the company would open up more mobile inventory and begin experimenting with app ads in Q3 and Q4. While eBay had mostly avoided mobile advertising in favor of a clean interface, Donahoe acknowledged "there’s some tasteful ways to add some ads into a mobile experience that doesn’t detract." Since eBay began its mobile presence, it’s received 260 million downloads, gaining 6.6 million new customers in Q2. Additionally, mobile-enabled commerce volume (ECV), which is basically the transactions that go through eBay, increased 26% in Q2 2014 to $62 billion, accounting for 20% of eBay’s total volume.Earnings release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LhL2yADP0600A0>  Donahoe also alluded to better leveraging eBay's first-party data, if not for advertisers, then to reach out via CRM and email campaigns to drive lapsed eBay users, scared away following the data breach, back to the site.

iB2B

IBM and Apple struck an enterprise deal on Tuesday, through which IBM will create big data analytics and business apps for use on iPhones and iPads. So far, Apple hasn’t had much luck convincing large corporations to buy iPhones and iPads in bulk – at least, not like Blackberry's success circa 2002. “The kind of deep industry expertise you would need to really transform the enterprise isn’t in our DNA. But it is in IBM’s,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. Read on at Re/code. <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW06z0B4L0M2AAP00q0Dh00> 

DOOH Meets Mobile

A new Clear Channel platform, Connect, aims to reimagine how mobile users connect to, and interact with, outdoor advertisements. Connect will launch in 28 US cities and in Toronto, and the North American debut accompanies a partnership with ad tech firm Blue Bite. It works by attaching tags to digital and static outdoor ads in high-traffic areas like storefronts, bus stops and shopping malls. Pedestrians interact via mobile location sensors.

Down The Rabbit Hole

"The marketing world is getting curiouser and curiouser," writes Doug Weaver in a response to Walmart's newfound marketing platform, WMX. "The basic notions of identity and structure in the advertising world are falling away." Weaver enumerates the oddities he sees as the industry transforms: publishers soliciting marketers, agency trading desks becoming ad networks, cats and dogs living together.

Search And Social Rising

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

eBay Ads’ Thakar Joins LivingSocial

Gautam Thakar <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0c0P4qA02000WLG0o0A6DB>  has moved on from eBay Advertising and will join LivingSocial as its new CEO and president in mid-August. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02H000pc006PW04DABAqL0> . Thakar’s responsibility at eBay Ads was extensive, according to his Linkedin <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0c0P4qA02000WLG0o0A6DB>  profile: “Responsible for leading eBay's Advertising business including the Shopping.com business. Led a global cross functional team across US, UK, DE, FR, AU and manage all aspects of a large profitable P&L. Key part of the role was transforming Shopping.com to a broader advertising business and leading the business, technology and product teams through a significant transformation and on path to be a large ad-tech player.” It would appear Thakar is returning to his Shopping.com roots by moving to the daily deals site, which had been left for dead by many.

Reporting Viewability

In April 2013, Google’s Active View viewability metric was  <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PrBJD000qA2c04L06> “blessed” by the Media Ratings Council (MRC), which has established independent, third-party standards around viewability of online advertising. On Tuesday, claiming it’s good for brands, Google product manager Sanaz Ahari announced that “the new currency” (i.e., Active View) was officially a part of reporting for the DoubleClick advertising platform. Ahari ascended the pulpit of the DoubleClick Advertiser blog and wrote, “The transition to viewable impressions will not happen overnight, but as more brands, agencies and publishers adopt the viewable standard, we can create a more transparent and actionable display ecosystem for brand advertisers.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/I060KWD0L4Ps0A2q0c0BA00> . Simply, tech is creating more transparency – which is good for Google as the dollars flow to and through its tech platform. That’s direct-response dollars, brand dollars, all dollars.

Weeding Bots

Cars.com realized something was askew with its web traffic about seven years ago and has since dedicated time and resources to weeding out the bots. Sites like TrueCar and AutoTrader similarly host millions of legitimate visitors a month, but are seeing suspicious surges in traffic. Bot traffic in the auto industry risks damaging the online aggregator sites' relationships with dealers, as inventory is purportedly viewed but never bought. "If you look at the success of AutoTrader over the years, we've built up a large number of listings," says Scott Hernalsteen, AutoTrader's senior director of enterprise analytics. "They could be trying to acquire [the information], accumulate it to repackage it and sell it to others. At the end of the day, we typically don't know."

The Funnel Of Effectiveness

On Tuesday, Adaptly, Refinery28 and Facebook surfaced with a joint study on the science of social media marketing. The study drills down into the metrics of digital advertising by comparing the effectiveness of leading a consumer down the marketing funnel versus delivering a single call to action. The research hypothesizes that broader brand stories beat out call to action messaging, and the study used Facebook Custom Audience for its data. Results showed that ad sequencing led to an 87% increase in overall view-through and 56% more subscriptions. The takeaway suggests that advertisers would be wise to build brand stories.

Slicing The Digital Ad Pie

Microsoft will surpass Yahoo in shares of the global digital ad market this year, eMarketer reported on Tuesday. Microsoft's net global ad revenues will account for 2.54% of worldwide shares, up 20% from 2013 and totaling $3.56 billion, according to estimates. Meanwhile, Yahoo's share of the global digital ad market will account for just 2.52%.

Track The Vote

Political campaigning is taking a cue from ad tech style targeting, says The Wall Street Journal, and leveraging data from Deep Root Analytics to inform a pivot from blanket TV advertising.

General Electric is now among the handful of brands that are testing the waters, joining others like the NBA, IHOP and Audi. GE is already active on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook building brand awareness. The company was an early Instagram brand partners, and one of the first to pay for sponsored posts. Still no news on monetisation via Snapchat, but the company did add new features on Tuesday that might signal more avenues for brands to climb aboard.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Mobile Versus Television

Tremor Video, Millward Brown and the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) partnered on a new study looking at impacts on brands using mobile video versus television. Adweek reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0xL00002P02BAqD60Z40A> , “The mobile ads were measured against TV benchmarks associated with each word. Twenty of the mobile ads over-indexed TV’s benchmark for participants who said they were ‘attracted’ or ‘unimpressed’ with the mobile ads. Nineteen of the mobile ads were associated more with ‘excitement’ than TV spots.” And, read the related release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/g00D40L0q206BA0AW000z3P> 

Facebook’s Secret Weapon?

In advance of Facebook’s earnings call next week, Susquehanna analyst Brian Nowak feels pretty good about the social network’s prospects. The reason? When Facebook users log on using their smartphones they generally stay logged on — a behavior Nowak said will help Facebook serve more targeted ads and ultimately increase CPMs. Facebook’s mobile display ad business may be fledgling, but mobile log on might have the potential to nudge it ahead of the competition.Read more at Seeking Alpha <http://go.adexchanger.com/u10000DB4L0A0A023PqWA60> .

In The Cloud

Gigaom Research recently surveyed several hundred digital marketers in order to determine what marketing tactics were the most-used and most effective, in order to suggest the perfect cocktail for marketing cloud providers. Social media marketing topped the charts as most-used tactic for marketers with big budgets, according to survey data, just barely beating display advertising. For marketers working with smaller budgets, email and SEO ranked as first and second most-used tactics. But Gigaom Research says that although social marketing is growing among major players, ROI remains a major problem. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/o022000B3006PW04DABAqL0> .

Introducing C-Zero

While programmers and broadcasters bicker over C7 versus C3, one publisher is pushing for "C-Zero." The idea was introduced by Scripps Networks in an attempt to counteract broadcasters' push for C7, according to the network's president Steve Gigliotti.  C-Zero denotes that broadcasters get paid for commercials that are seen live or on the same day they air, as opposed to the seven-day or three-day window  of C7 of C3. So far, at least one agency is on board - Zenith media. "For specific categories an aged message can be more harmful then helpful," explained Zenith President John Nitti. The benefits are also contextual - say, for timely marketing around the holidays or an end-of-year sale. Read on at Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/q6AW0A0DLC004302B0P300q> .

Messaging Ads

APAC-based messaging app WeChat is trialing a new ad service that aims to help brands better target their audiences. The new service offers a dashboard where advertisers can specify target demographics, which WeChat will then link automatically to relevant corporate pages that will display the ads.  "With the latest trends in programmatic, it's a good move by Tencent to focus on targeting, in order to move to audience buying," said Charlie Wang, digital director of Mindshare Beijing. Yet, Wang was hesitant to say that the popular messaging app might evolve into an ad platform on par with Twitter of Facebook.

Expanding The Tentacles

LinkedIn keeps trying to make itself more sticky as the its M&A tentacles reached out and acquired start-up Newsle to expand its tracking capabilities of the content your contacts create. The buy rides the coattails of somewhat recent purchases of SlideShare and the news aggregation app Pulse.The terms of the deal were not disclosed, although a Newsle blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0606WD0L4PF0A2q030BA00>  shared that founders Axel Hansen and Jonah Varon would be joining the LinkedIn team while the company continued as a stand-alone business.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Platforms Grab For Content<

Without unique content, your fancy tech platform may not matter. On that note... Over the weekend, Reuters reported that YouTube was in talks with Hollywood and independent producers to fund premium content. If realized, the deals could graduate YouTube from a DIY platform for video streaming to one worthy of higher-priced advertising. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0XA0DB0Wv2Lq005A00X4P0> . Meanwhile, "South Park" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone announced a three-year deal that gives Hulu exclusive streaming rights to the show's back catalogue. The $80 million deal is in line with attempts by other streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon, to lock down premium content and ultimately draw in advertisers. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LXw2YADP0500A0> .

Oh My Gahd

According to a study by Contently, Internet users would rather see a banner ad than read a native content piece. [See related Charlton Heston “Omega Man” clip.] <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L05qW0D00ZAxB0X4PA>  Contently surveyed 542 US Internet users aged 18-65, and found a fair amount of confusion and mistrust for native advertising. Only 48% of respondents believed "sponsored content" meant an advertiser paid for the article and had control over its content, whereas 52% said it meant something different. What's more, 54% of online readers don't trash sponsored content, and 59% of readers say a site loses credibility for running brand-sponsored content. Go here for the study <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000X2y50L0B00A4PDAq> .

Ecommerce Goes Native

"The last bastion of major web companies is now embracing native, and that group is the largest ecommerce companies in the world," TripleLift's co-founder and chief strategy officer, Ari Lewine, told Ad Age. The ad tech company has partnered with ecommerce reviews business Bazaarvoice, which also owns a media business courtesy of its purchase of Longboard Media in November 2012 <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP0010zL0XW00AD2q05A04> . The companies are working to launch native spots that run alongside retailer products. Former PubMatic exec Josh Wetzel, GM of Bazaarvoice Media, said brands across industries are "looking to shift away from traditional banner ads in favor of a more native look. … The idea is to influence the consumer when they have their wallet out." Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0XA0DB0WA2Lq005A0024P0> . And read about TripleLift’s ‘take’ on native advertising on AdExchanger from May <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00BWqA0005PXA03040D2L> .

Rebates Bolster Programmatic

The Wall Street Journal and Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser took another look at rebates and the agency model on Friday. A lack of agency-marketer trust around rebates may be a factor shifting marketers to in-house programmatic trading, according to The Wall Street Journal. Marketers claim rebates aren’t factored into their deals with media agencies and their trading desks. “If marketers don’t trust their agencies in this area to begin with, or if their procurement and finance teams have concerns about tracking rebates, this will be a factor that makes disintermediation more likely," Wieser wrote in a research note on Friday, "especially as more and more digital media (and media, in general) is bought programmatically." Read more (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0050CX0W4DP0L0A00> . Related: rebates were mentioned as a possible concern in a 2011 study on agency trading desks commissioned by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Read that one <http://go.adexchanger.com/Uq5P04A0LB0WAX0250000DD> .

In The Beginning

TubeMogul’s founders Brett Wilson and John Hughes discuss the early stages of their company and its “pivot” in 2010 in a profile piece on The FT.  Wilson, the company’s CEO, explains the move to a video ad media buying platform and away from a pure analytics play, “We did not see the analytics as a major disruptive business and we wanted to build something really big,”  Read it (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4X060P00qD002LBW0EA5> . Ripple dissolve:here’s the 2010 AdExchanger interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW07L0000XP02BAqD50F40A>  with Wilson discussing the changes.

Salesforce.com Tucks In

Salesforce.com has struck a deal to buy RelateIQ for $390 million, says Re/code. CEO Steve Loughlin confirmed the acquisition in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00XA0L0DH005B2qW0A9P04>  on Friday. RelateIQ’s  platform uses algorithms to capture data from email, calendar and phone calls to provide users insights on real-time behaviors. Loughlin claimed the insights from his company’s product will lend new levels of intelligence across Salesforce’s marketing offerings.

Seriously Interactive

Adtile has surfaced with a new set of rich mobile ads that take user interaction to a whole new level. The California-based company says it used components of airplane and submarine physics to design HTML5 ads that connect to a smartphone's GPS, gyroscope, motion coprocessor, compass and accelerometer (huh?). Simply put, the ads respond to motion, says CEO Nils Forsbolm, and are designed with localized geotargeting in mind. Read on at VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DJA02000BWX0q45bLP0A> .

Organic Metrics

Twitter released a new analytics tool on Friday that aims to lend hard metrics to a tweet's performance. Previously, the social media site offers advertisers certain data around sponsored tweets, such as impressions, replies and clicks. The new dashboard, extends organic Tweet analytics to include total impression, total engagements and engagement rates over a period of time (think Google Analytics' interface).

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Microsoft Repositions

In a companywide message distributed to Microsoft employees Thursday, CEO Satya Nadella spoke on Microsoft’s transition from a technology provider to a devices and services company. In particular, Nadella stresses Microsoft’s need to focus on productivity and platforms. Detailing Microsoft's cloud OS, device OS and first-party hardware, Nadella notes that the tech industry's shift toward mobile will play a role in future strategizing. "We're really in the infant stages of the mobile-first world," writes Nadella in the company memo. "In the next few years we will see many more new categories evolve and experiences emerge that span a variety of devices of all screen sizes. Microsoft will be on the forefront of this innovation with a particular focus on dual users and their needs across work and life." Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000J2040qA5LPDBQo0WA0> .

Virtual Vending

Facebook announced on Thursday <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0pQ5WPK0A00>  a new ad offering on desktop for app developers. The offering centers on promoting and selling virtual goods, such as points or tools in gaming apps. Last year Facebook updated its desktop app ad offerings for game developers to monetize their players, and the company has always allowed developers to vend virtual goods in apps. "Now, with desktop app ads for virtual goods, developers can take both of these products a step further and engage players with promotions outside of their app," explains Pin Lu, a software engineer at Facebook. Read more at Inside Facebook <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW05L0B4L0q2AAP00q0DQ00> .

Weaving For Wearables

Mindshare is betting on wearable tech, and on Thursday formed a new task unit devoted to directing ad spend into the wearable market. Mindshare's managing director of mobile, Jeff Malmad, will lead the unit, Life+, which will focus on fitness trackers, smartwatches and virtual reality devices. Speaking to Ad Age, Mindshare Chief Digital Officer Norm Johnston called wearable tech the third wave in digital advertising (following display and mobile). But he stressed that wearable devices need more native content in lieu of traditional advertising. "They're quite intimate and the data shared is very sensitive," he said. "It's not about just slapping up ads." A curious turn of phrase. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/TM0WQ0P05000DBr20L4qAA0> !

Sponsored Ads Succeed

Native advertising often engages audience less than regular content, but native’s underperformance might have a great deal to do with context. In fact, Upworthy says its sponsored content often pulls more traffic than regular posts. According to Upworthy, branded content typically gets three times the shares and 3.5  times the page views. Digiday has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/gs0D40L0q205BA0AW000NQP> .

Mobile Bridge Exits Stealth

Mobile Bridge came out of stealth at the MobileBeat conference on Wednesday, and CEO Eyal Oste spoke more about the product to VentureBeat on Thursday. Mobile Bridge is a marketing automation platform for mobile advertisers with a focus on automated geotargeting. But Oster explained that geotargeted ads isn't enough – context is also key. Mobile Bridge therefore pulls in data like weather and whether the mobile user is walking or jogging. This allows marketers to serve ads that are more relevant.

TechCrunch reports, “The market is predicted to double in size between now and 2018, reaching the 2 billion mark, with smart TVs carrying embedded platforms as the main segment to watch.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0050nL0WDDP0L0A00> . TV ads will be video ads –and the other way around.

Moore’s Law

Facebook and Twitter are both looking to grow mobile and video ad revenue beyond their own properties, says a new article on Digiday. For Facebook, the signal was last week's LiveRail acquisition. For Twitter, it was the purchase of four ad tech companies since the start of 2014 (Gnip, Namo Media, SnappyTV and TapCommerce). Xaxis chairman David Moore says the danger is in partnering with the competition. “If I was a publisher, I would always be wary of someone that has its own inventory and is offering to sell mine,” Moore says.

Nearing The Full Nielsen

The Hollywood Reporter covers Nielsen’s tablet and mobile ratings service coming this fall <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40p0A2L0BFLD0W5P00q0A0> . Apparently, the new measurement platforms will only measure linear ads (like TV), ignoring dynamic ads (you know, targeted like digital!). Nielsen exec Cheryl Idell confirmed the news at a Television Critics Association panel, where she also made a point of mentioning that traditional live TV was not waning. When asked by one reporter if Nielsen would launch similar measurement platforms for streamers, Idell said, "We're not in business with Netflix yet, but we would love to be..."

Trifurcation

The IAB’s head of brand initiatives, Peter Minnium, describes the future of ad formats in a think piece on Marketing Land. He writes, “The future is likely to see a trifurcation of ad types which loosely align with strategic intent: concept ads, content ads, and commerce ads. Next Generation ad standards must enable each of these very different forms to thrive.”  See the charts <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0050qL0WGDP0L0A00> .

Showrooming Is Your Friend

A new study challenges the conception that mobile use is threatening in-store consumerism. According to a new study by G/O Digital, a marketing firm in the Gannett family, a majority of shoppers value in-store coupons over the convenience of ecommerce. Interestingly, iBeacons may be key to in-store success: "The end goal should be to create a seamless, customer-focused shopping experience – from the second screen to physical stores – that is as easy-to-use, intuitive, and engaging as possible."

Scarcely In Control

In this week's Drift column, Doug Weaver predicts a virtual renaissance in the TV/video ecosystem based on a handful of considerations. TV is not one business, he suggests, but several, and each division's approach to digital differs. Weaver opines, "I’ve always thought that what truly separated ‘TV’ and ‘digital’ was the portion of supply that could be controlled. So far, broadcasters and agencies have done a good job of using scarcity and control to keep a profitable model thriving.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PKBuD000qA2L04L05> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Location Location Location

Analytics and marketing platform Upsight <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W05uA0q0j0BAL0PDG2>  is adding another layer of targeting to geolocation data. The company released a new tool on Tuesday, GeoTrigger, that helps marketers target key consumers based on where they are and what they might want. For instance, if a mobile user passes by a storefront, marketers can sent out coupons to that user, but mobile users must opt in for marketers to receive location data. Marketers can also preprogram "geofences," or strategic boundaries that trigger marketing campaigns. Read more on VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLGWk0AP5v020qD40> . And read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqwB052LW004D0P0AAl0G00> .

Mobile Ad Budget Battle

In an interview with Ad Age, Millennial Media CEO Michael Barrett details his plans to take on major players in the mobile-ad business. Despite Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pandora taking the majority of mobile ad budgets, Barrett argues Millennial Media 's offerings for cross-device tracking and attribution set it apart. "It's a helluva lot easier moving from mobile, what we have, to online than having all these cookies and trying to figure out what the person looks like on mobile," said Barrett. "We're in a very leveraged position to take advantage of that. It's a significant piece of the revenue now. In the coming months, we'll open that up and make it part of the transaction stream in the exchange. That will give us a nice differentiation."

High-Impact Ads

Intrusive ads are on the rise across browsing devices, reports Digiday. In 2013, the top 10 publishers of high-impact ads served a total of 8,989. In the first six months of 2014, publishers ran 4,971 high-impact ads (data from Moat Pro). At this rate, high-impact ads are on track to be 11% higher than last year. One suggested reason for the increase is that the media landscape is becoming more cluttered, and marketers are competing for attention.

Comcast In Control

Comcast's acquisition of FreeWheel in March <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4G0z0P00qD002LBW0oA5>  may be making big media providers wary, according to The Wall Street Journal. Companies such as Time Warner, Viacom, Walt Disney Co. and 21st Century Fox all use FreeWheel's tech to serve ads across TV, tablets, smartphones and desktop. Ad digital ad spend increases, some worry Comcast might have the upper hand. "I understand that on paper it's a concern,” responded Comcast’s VP of advanced advertising, Rob Holmes. “But our goal is to maximize the value of FreeWheel to the overall ecosystem, and not respecting our clients data in some way would run counter to those purposes.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW05A0B4L0p2AAP00q0DG00>  (subscription).

PubNative Gets (App)Lift Off

Programmatic and native advertising might seem like “strange bedfellows,” but that hasn’t stopped mobile games marketing platform AppLift from funding native ad platform PubNative <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PBB00000AG4Dq025Wq0>  to the tune of a seven-figure backing. Specific terms were not revealed. As a mobile SSP and native ad exchange, PubNative, which launched Tuesday, is the third in a string of mobile launches in the last two months, following closely on the heels of InMobi and NativeX. But not everyone is convinced of the marriage. Read more at MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/gr0D40L0q205BA0AW000CGP> .

Pinterest Gone Fishing

On Tuesday, Pinterest introduced an animated "Follow Pin" feature designed with businesses and brands in mind. The new feature is not associated with any fee, according to one Pinterest spokesperson. Instead, it appears to be Pinterest's ways of inciting brands to think of their platform in order to drive usage and traffic. Pinterest product manager Jason Costa explained, “Your visitors won’t ever have to leave your website to follow you.” Read what that means on TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/ut0000DB4L0A0E02GPqWA50> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Correlating Viewability

Nielsen has surfaced with a new multitouch attribution (MTA) product that aims to provide an exact correlation of ads viewed to products purchased and presumably a more granular take on return on ad spend. Nielsen piloted its MTA product with Kraft. MTA ran Kraft's data against purchaser information from Nielsen's database to uncover consumer behavior that helped the company restructure campaigning based on the volume of products purchased. Adweek has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PxBtD000qA2z04L05> .

In-App Ad Investment

As Facebook, Twitter, Google and Yahoo all court in-app advertising features, it's still unclear if brands are willing to invest. "App-install dollars are not going to grow faster than they did four quarters ago," commented Brian Wong, the CEO of mobile ad company Kiip. "It remains to be seen whether that unit is sufficient for the brand marketer's needs." Mobile ad network Kargo's CEO, Harry Kargman, added, "When the dollars start to dry up, [social companies] will start thinking … 'How do we repurpose that same real estate that we've carved out in a way to capture brand dollars?'"

Social’s Media DNA

Social media sites like Facebook might be disrupting traditional media channels, says Gartner research VP Andrew Frank, but social sites are also helping the ad industry evolve. Facebook's LiveRail acquisition and Twitter's TapCommerce purchase support the monetize-social-audience trend. "Facebook (unlike Twitter) filters news feeds algorithmically – this is its equivalent of an editorial voice," writes Frank. Yet, Google and Facebook are also in the business to serve marketers. "That means consolidating influence..." Read more via Gartner <http://go.adexchanger.com/gv0D40L0q205BA0AW000zzP> .

WPP’s Take On Global Ad Trends

In a LinkedIn feature, WPP founder and CEO Sir Martin Sorrell outlines 10 trends shaping the global advertising business. The list pulls observations based on operations in the 110 countries in which WPP does business. This may lend insight into WPP’s possible future strategy. On Sorrell's list are changing power dynamics in retail, the growing reputation of international communications, disintermediation and an excess of supply within the marketing ecosystem (except for talent). Also, power is shifting south, east and southeast. Go here for the full list <http://go.adexchanger.com/I050wWD0L4PA0A2q0z0BA00> .

Data Recruit

Adbrain announced on Monday the appointment of former Xaxis, GroupM and AOL veteran Tim Abraham. Abraham will move into his new role as director of data platforms, where he'll work with Adbrain's engineering team to expand data-management capabilities and facilitate strategic data partnerships with a focus on mobile-first data.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Twitter’s Bottomless Profit

In a flattering profile of the Twitter ads team, which has been relatively untouched during recent executive machinations, The NY Times' Bits blog sees a profitable future for the social (ad) platform. Twitter’s Adam Bain and Kevin Weil are given props as the NYT’s writers conclude: “Ultimately, even if Twitter never adds another user, most analysts expect that Mr. Bain and his team could keep increasing revenue for some time just by showing more and better ads to current users, especially internationally, where very few ads appear in the main feed.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4u0Q0P00qD002LBW0RA5> . The last major ads-related departure was Satya Patel <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DSA02000BWu0q45RLP0A> , who was VP of product at Twitter from 2011-2012 – eons ago in Internet years.

The Investing Movement

Angel investor and bon vivant Jerry Neumann puts his barbecue tongs down just long enough over the Fourth of July holiday to deliver a tome on venture capital investing – i.e., betting. From his personal blog, he reminds readers that the big win$ are rare and adds, “We should be so lucky to see another tech movement like electricity or mass manufacturing or the internet again in our lifetimes. The really big ones come once every couple of generations. But the big-but-not-enormous ones come all the time. Mobile, programmatic advertising, big data and 3-D printing are all examples of technological movements that are big enough to sustain an ecosystem of companies...” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0Tu5WPS0A00> .

36% Fraud, 50% Not Viewed

In an interview published Friday with Joe Mandese of MediaPost, GroupM’s Ari Bluman revisits – and continues to stand behind – his media-buying group’s decision to stop buying through open exchanges. Part of the interview: “Mandese: You’re saying you want to stay out of the riffraff, the long-tail of online audiences. But that riffraff is your audience. Consumers are on pages that ads are being served to. Bluman: Hopefully, but 36% of it is fraud and 50% of it’s not viewed.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000T2040qA5LPDBuU0WA0> .

Owning The Content

The big Internet “pipes” companies continue to circle the wagons around content. Apparently, Amazon has some catching up to do where streaming video is concerned, according to analysts from Piper Jaffray. "While significantly inferior to Netflix, and even more to Hulu, we believe Amazon is driving video in the right direction by focusing on TV shows,” said analyst Gene Munster. “TV series are easier to acquire, as the contracts tend to be non-exclusive and less locked up than movie content.” Munster mentioned that Netflix's original series buy the company an advantage.

What’s The Frequency, Kenneth?

Facebook’s reach and frequency metrics for June may be off for some Facebook page owners. Inside Facebook sources the report and says Facebook has posted the following message to some page admins: “There is a discrepancy in the engagement and reach metrics for all Page Posts and Boosted Posts between 5/30 and 6/30. We are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible...” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PWBXD000qA2u04L05> . That’s going to be a bit of double-work for whoever's in charge of your social ad stats.

Automating The Tube

As the ad tech industry ventures deeper down the digitalization rabbit hole, TV advertising may need to reimagine its processes, says David Cooperstein, Simulmedia CMO and former Forrester VP. In a contributing feature for Forbes, Cooperstein suggests automation is key. “I am not saying that TV needs to become digital in terms of interactivity,” writes Cooperstein, “but it does need to become a digital business in the context of improving the processes that a) make the buying process simpler and b) unlock revenues that are held back by current practices and technology. What better way to do that then to automate buys across networks, tie impressions to results, and market to people rather than broadly defined audiences?” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/uZ0000DB4L0A0Y02uPqWA50> .

Total, Tablet Ad, Recall

Serving ads on tablets is as efficient as serving ads in print magazines, according to a study by GfK released on Thursday. GfK’s  MRI Starch Advertising Research unit surveyed nearly 29,000 ads across 805 tablets published in 2013. Research showed that ads in tablet versions of magazines and those same ads in print both yielded a 52% level of recall. The data suggests that tablet-edition ads have yet to leverage digital advantages over print advertisements. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/DW040000ABD00v05L02P0Aq> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Blinkx Slides

The FT reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/gp0D40L0q205BA0AW000flP>  that online video advertising company Blinkx lost a third of its value in the public markets as it announced revenues would fall short of expectations. The company said in a release <http://go.adexchanger.com/iglW00B5PqL00A000Dq2A04> , “During the last three months, which are seasonally the smallest quarter of the year, we saw lower than forecast demand – specifically within Desktop – with a corresponding shortfall in revenues and EBITDA. The shortfall was exaggerated toward the end of the quarter. We attribute this performance to industry-wide issues of efficiency and effectiveness, which, in our case was compounded by the lingering effects of the disparaging blog [by Ben Edelman] about the Company.” AdExchanger chronicled the war between Edelman and Blinkx in April. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/gr0D40L0q205BA0AW000hlP> .

Missed Call Marketing

Facebook is honing in on a new way to serve ads to high-growth countries, where the majority of mobile users access the Web via feature phones or the equivalent. To save mobile users data and minutes, Facebook is testing a "missed call" feature, basically a prod for the marketer to respond. When a person sees an ad on Facebook, they can click on it to receive content they're interested in such as music or sports scores (served alongside brand messages from marketers). Facebook is testing the feature in India, and early tests with Garnier Men show positive results. Read the Facebook product report <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0s5A00ilD0AP00040> .

Video Ad Interaction

Video tech company Fuisz Media unveiled new capabilities for interactive elements within video ads on Wednesday. The company also announced an additional $2 million in funding and the securing of some heavyweight enterprise clients like Nike, Target and Walmart. The new offering lets viewers hover over certain object within video ads, and click through on certain products to share on social media, online purchase or product research. For its interactive video ads, Fuisz Media is showing click-through rates 20% or higher, which is unheard of. Read more via TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D5BqA0020P0WtAlj00> .

Planning Instagram Ads

Ikea is taking a new approach to native advertising through an interlinked website on Instagram. Russian ad agency Instinct developed the Instagram account for Ikea, ikea_ps_2014, to showcase the retail giant's April collection. “We wanted to create something really cool. And then we noticed similarities between Instagram tags and website links," explains Instinct creative director Nikolay Fabrik. The account works like a virtual catalog of sorts that leverages Instagram's tagging feature to help users navigate the collection. Digiday has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/Al0k04WB200A5Pq00L0u0DA> .

Mobile Killed The Radio Star

Mobile advertising will account for 9.8% of the total US ad marketplace, according to data from eMarketer. Mobile ads beat out newspapers (9.3%), magazines (8.4%) and radio (8.6%), and brands are spending 83% more on mobile ads and tablets in 2014 than in 2013. The report projects that investments in mobile ads will increase the general ad market by 5.3% YoY in 2014 to $180. Adweek suggests <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PlDlA40L5B00vA>  that Fabebook, Google and Twitter are ahead of the curve for their focus on mobile over the past few years.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Googling Video

Video ad platform BrightRoll announced the hire of Bruce Falck <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LfK2uADP0500A0>  as chief operating officer. Falck previously ran <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B05AAv0DLf00>  Google’s demand-side platform business, a.k.a. DoubleClick Bid Manager (née Invite Media), among other duties. According to the release, Falck will “oversee day-to-day operations at BrightRoll and is responsible for leading sales, marketing and business development…” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLP5M4B00W000qAf0020AwD> . CEO Tod Sacerdoti, who founded BrightRoll in 2006, is likely building out the exec team <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00x0NL0fW00AD2q05A04>  in preparation for an IPO –unless BrightRoll gets gobbled up beforehand. More in the WSJ (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/iyfW00B5POL00A000Dq2A04> .

Analyzing Big Marketing

Big-data tech company MapR, used  <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PzDfA40L5B00PA> by Rubicon Project, comScore and others, has raised $110 million in financing, says TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBA000Af50A200WL4qPQ00> . MapR VP of Product Tomer Shiran explained one use case to AdExchanger: “Cisco, for example, developed a 360-degree customer application that’s collecting all the information that it knows about its customers, from the billing system, support system, social media and every interaction point it has with its customers. And it uses that for lead generation.” Enterprise, “big data” inputs for the omnichannel marketer. There are more use cases <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PzDfA40L5B00PA> .

Fraud Everywhere

When the MRC advisory to avoid buying video impressions lifted <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02R000Bf005PW04DABAqL0>  on Monday, it appeared to set off a burglar alarm among vendors, who began hollering about video ad impression thievery. DoubleVerify, for instance, announced it had uncovered <http://go.adexchanger.com/iCfW00B5PSL00A000Dq2A04>  a massive video ad fraud scheme “involving over 500 sites and impacting over 1% of all video ad impressions across the Internet.” Telemetry (one of the three vendors accredited by the MRC) described <http://go.adexchanger.com/q5AW0A0DLD004f02B0PT00q> a months-long ad fraud operation that hit 75 advertisers, in which fraudsters tampered with products from Tremor, Adap.tv and Integral Ad Science, fooling the tools into believing video ads were viewed when in fact they weren’t.

Streaming Returns

As television streaming continues to gain ground, CBS says it’s poised to profit. “We actually make more money per viewer streaming than we do on television,” said CBS CRO and President David F. Poltrack. “If you stream our programming online, you’re seeing a full complement of advertising – you can’t bypass it.” In fact, CBS reports it actually earns 20% more in online ad revenue than per live viewer. Most TV viewing is still on television, but Nielsen data shows that the percentage is shrinking (89% of TV viewing was live in Q1 2011 compared to 80% in 2014).

Programmatic Analytics

Metamarkets has released a real-time analytics platform for programmatic advertising, partnering with exchanges like Chartboost, Flurry, Inneractive, Millennial Media, MobPro, MoPub, OpenX, Smaato and Vungle. As programmatic budgets expand, Metamarkets is banking that real-time analytics will become a must-have since it’ll enable advertisers to make better decisions much more quickly.

Patenting Voter Targeting

Audience Partners says it’s patented audience targeting of voters. A new release announces approval of a US patent and explains, “The patented technology provides the ability to use publicly available voter registration records and political demographic data such as party affiliation, voting history and political geography to target and place advertising and messaging across millions of websites.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/q5AW0A0DLH004f02B0PX00q> .

Privacy Attribution

Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary of Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 2.0, also known as the FTC's update to the COPPA. Yesterday, mobile attribution and analytics company Kochava announced plans to roll COPPA compliance tools into its platform. Kochava is integrating an age-gating mechanism called AgeCheq, which it will extend to mobile apps and games at no charge to its clients.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Defining Viewability

On Monday, the Media Rating Council adopted its new video viewability metric, which marks the first attempt to address industrywide invisibility issues. Get the PDF <http://go.adexchanger.com/q4AW0A0DLD004Z02B0Pa00q> . However, many marketers take issue with the MRC's two-second delineation. “Two seconds is not, by any means, a great representation of a 15-second [ad],” said Spark SMG VP and digital director Amy Dickerson. “But it’s better than what we had.” The MRC offered that the metric will evolve as ad-tracking tech improves. Adweek has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00bWqA0004PZA0E040D2L> .

Report: Twitter Acquiring

Twitter is slated to acquire mobile ad tech firm TapCommerce, Re/code reported Monday. The transaction is estimated to close for $100 million, although Twitter has yet to confirm this figure. Read a bit more <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0Z0P4qA02000WLc0F0A4DB> . In December, TapCommerce CEO Brian Long discussed his company’s ad biz momentum with AdExchanger: “I think people have been saying for a long time that this is the year mobile commerce will really take off. We’ve gone from seeing 10% of [brand] revenues increase to 40% of revenues (coming from mobile).” Read that one. <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqGP04A0LB0WAZ0240000dD> 

Widgeting Native

Google may be gearing up for massive-scale native advertising, Digiday reports. The search giant is purportedly trailing a widget with a handful of publishers that includes links to content and ads. “Think about the retargeting options," said Steve Rubel, chief content strategist at Edelman. "A content-recommendation-slash-native-advertising offer would be low-hanging fruit for Google.” However, a widget like this poses certain security risks (think Taboola's hacked widget <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP4e0Zq0AD00B4H020W0>  on Reuters last week). Read more via Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P04IA0000q0Df20LAWZ> .

Mobile Ads And Privacy

Three quarters of mobile users feel targeted advertising is an invasion of privacy, according to a new study by Razorfish. The global study surveyed 1,500 participants in the UK, the US, China and Brazil. “If brands are not able to understand how data is going to be important to them, how to merge systems, not just what they are getting from digital touch points, but offline as well and make smart decisions, then there is a disconnect," said Sarah Sikowitz, principal analyst for Forrester. "Agencies don't have it all figured out yet," she added. "Marketers are doing it very well but there is still a shift that has to happen in a lot of organizations.” Read more at The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B04AAJ0DgZ00> .

Automated B2B

LinkedIn is piloting a program that aims to help marketers target Internet ads by leveraging the site's network of users. GroupM's programmatic arm Xaxis and ad tech firm Dstillery are among the companies trailing the new product, the WSJ reports, to varying degrees of success. According to the WSJ's sources, some marketers are pleased with the product while others complain about a lack of LinkedIn audience responsiveness. LinkedIn is also testing the waters of a programmatic private exchange, mirroring GroupM's move <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0hZ0L40DB0K0W0q4P20A0A>  mid-June.
