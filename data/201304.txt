Programmatic, Indoors And Out

 

Automation isn't just for websites anymore. The WSJ's Suzanne Vranica focuses on how programmatic tools are being used for radio and out-of-home buying, which are among the oldest traditional media formats. "We are always looking for ways to make it simpler to put together an out-of-home campaign," said Clear Channel CEO William Eccleshare.

Salesforce.com Trumps SAP

 

Salesforce.com has grabbed the title of largest worldwide CRM away from SAP, according to a new report from Gartner. The research firm also noted total CRM software revenue rose 12.5% to $18 billion from last year. "Competition among CRM software vendors really heated up in 2012, as major players continued to vie for broader market penetration internationally and more widespread adoption within midsize to large enterprises," said Joanne Correia, vice president at Gartner, in a statement.

Lean Marketing

 

Marketers can benefit from testing their campaigns on a smaller scale using real-time bidding (RTB) before allocating huge budgets to them. Ratko Vidakovic, Director of Marketing at SiteScout, outlines four phases to getting the most out of a campaign: building, analyzing, optimizing and scaling. Vidakovic adds, "Knowing the inherent volatility in RTB volumes, approaching publishers for direct buys (after testing, of course) only makes sense."

RTB-Naysayer Gets Creative

Moreover, the publisher will be adding an in-house marketing shop dubbed Vox Creative, which would create blogs for sponsors.

Japan-based ecommerce marketplace Rakuten (formerly Buy.com) is breaking into the US market with a focus on shopping experiences rather than just utility.

Measuring Viral Bennies

 

While video analytics specialist Visible Measures doesn't promise the ability to make a viral video, its partnership with Publicis Groupe's VivaKi does try to quantify the value of a viral video with Contagion, an earned media measurement tool. "Our agencies can [use Contagion to] change campaign variables like the budget commitment, offline and online channel mix, site list, and more, and determine how these changes will affect overall campaign performance," said Kate Sirkin, Publicis SMG's global research director.

Hyperlocal RTB

 

Publishers have a potential opportunity to reap the benefits of RTB through local and hyperlocal geo-targeting, according to Dick O'Hare. By representing a very specific location, these publishers have an advantage over the somewhat unreliable method of IP-based geo-targeting. "In this rapidly evolving world, publishers become relegated to a supply of cookies for marketers to target versus an audience targetable through the association of the publisher's content and audience profiles," O'Hare says.

Frequency Capping

 

The idea of frequency capping is simple enough - make sure users aren't inundated with the same ad over and over across a series of sites - but agencies and publishers can't (or, in worst cases, won't) institute effective caps, according to a whitepaper by Michael Green, Audience Science's director of research and marketing strategy. In a relatively small study of what the researcher called "six typical campaigns run in Q4 2012 by large national advertisers," Audience Science found that "out-of-frequency impressions are not only common, they're the norm. No campaign delivered more than 40% of its impressions within the frequency cap, and one campaign saw over 3/4ths of its impressions exceed the cap."

Big Ads! - Native, Too

 

Yahoo announced at its NewFront presentation that it was adding a big old billboard ad on its home page as well as native advertising its calling "stream ads" - stories within Yahoo's stream of content. Anthony Ha at TechCrunch writes, "When I asked how the new ads will affect the consumer experience, [VP of Product and Media Mike Kerns] didn't say specifically, but he did note that's something Yahoo will be tracking - specifically how the ads affect the consumer engagement numbers on its properties."

Cheaper, Future Inventory

 

YouTube says its an "upfront" contrarian and is lowering rates for media buyers in a bid to attract a bigger share of those TV budgets. "Last year we were rigid; we got a few big advertisers with huge checks," YouTube sales chief Lucas Watson tells AdAge's Michael Learmonth. "We got a lot of feedback about being inflexible so now we are breaking them down into more manageable chunks."

More Yahoo Turmoil?

 

Yahoo Chairman Fred Amoroso announcing on Friday that he would not seek another term after only a year in the post has observers wondering if a clear direction for the portal is still a work-in-progress. In his official statement, Amoroso suggests that he's stepping down according to his previous plan and expressed security in Mayer at the helm, adding, "this is a natural time for me to transition off the board, consistent with what I said a year ago."

Marketing The Trends

 

On his personal blog, VivaKi's Rishad Tobaccowala outlines "Six Current and Six Rapidly Expanding Trends Marketers Should Focus On" that was also offered at the recent Publicis Investor Conference. Coming in at #5: "The future will be about more access and less ownership - Consumers increasingly want access to content (Spotify, Netflix etc.) or things (Zip car etc.) rather than just ownership. This will also be true in the world of big data."

Video Ad Guarantee

 

Jun Group has tapped the "money-back guarantee" in an effort to track new video advertisers to its ad network.

Whither The Audience

 

On Digiday, Jack Marshall says that ad buyers are frustrated with certain publisher audience development tactics. He notes, for example, Complex.com's SEO for porn-related terms. Marshall paraphrases Complex CEO Rich Antoniello who explains that "less than 6 percent of the publisher's traffic now comes from searches related to the word 'porn' and that it's not focusing on SEO to build audience. Rather, Antoniello said, it's been investing heavily in editorial staff..."

Omnicom Programmatic

 

Dan Salmon, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, hosted a meeting with Omnicom CFO Randy Weisenburger on Wednesday. In a note to investors after the meeting, Salmon writes, "With [Omnicom] having reported earnings last week, the conversation focused primarily on the long-term impact of the shift to digital on margins. Investors were eager to learn about the impact of programmatic ad buying: Omnicom believes it generates higher operating margins, but incremental technology investment washes out the benefit on an ROE basis. Today, the total media buying and planning business is about 11%-12% of Omnicom's revenue, while the still-small programmatic piece of it is profitable."

Facebook Parses App Development

 

Facebook continues to build up its mobile business by acquiring Parse, an app development tool for Apple iOS and Google Android. Parse is particularly focused on paid apps, so this could be a bid by Facebook to move away from a clear mobile ad strategy and ecommerce offerings. Doug Purdy, Facebook's Director of Product Management, says in an official blog post that the two companies have already been working together and not much will change in terms of Parse's branding. What's the appeal of owning Parse? Purdy writes that Parse "removes the need to manage servers and a complex infrastructure, so you can simply focus on building great user experiences."

Mobile Growth

 

Although highly fragmented, the audience for mobile apps has caught up with similar-sized audiences for other media, according to a new study by mobile analytics firm Flurry. "We conclude that the U.S. audience that is reachable through apps, albeit more fragmented, is now roughly equal to that which can be reached on laptops and desktops," writes Mary Ellen Gordon, director of industry insights and analysis at Flurry, in a blog post.

Cookieless Retargeting

 

Sequential Media has teamed up with supply-side platform Beanstock to bring cookieless retargeting to desktop and mobile with their domain relevancy algorithm. The platform, currently in beta, also claims to prevent "data leakage <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001PEBJn94ROtBIFomvb5howsDryAk7uW3JAmFKbofr1dGntCFn-yR15-eahpMe-MAl1G-fnraCpYaoxsZPHgGwvAq-bRLtS2a_yo_gVpE-D0-g0o6gP1XDbNCZNorfkDtB5whzG9ElT8BbiOrbWlleiCYhtpTn4jdEDqz0mehuk5s=> " for publishers.

Russian Display

 

Russian search company Yandex reported that its display advertising revenues grew 48% in the first quarter of 2013, which comes to 648,000,000 Russian rubles; in US dollars, assuming this editor has done his math right, that equals $20.8 million in revenue.

Nevertheless, under-the-radar Yandex is growing quickly.

The New Data Scientist

 

The demand for data scientists - people who have the skills and training to pull business insights out of big data - is so high that startups are stepping in to fill the gap, observes AdAge's Kate Kaye. "Their goal, in a nutshell, is to automate tasks once assigned to a data scientist or teams of technologists, making big-data capabilities possible for smaller companies," Kaye writes.

Amazon Ad Net Rumblings

 

Reuters describes some campaigns that have run on the Amazon's secretive ad network since late 2012. They included Kimberly-Clark (Huggies), Ubisoft, and an unnamed movie marketer. For the latter, "data on purchases of related DVDs, books and music on Amazon.com helped identify potential customers who were likely to see the movie at the theater and ads were targeted at this audience." Performance? "Above average," said the source.

'Do Not Track' Negotiator Plea

 

Last year the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) brought in Peter Swire to mediate between pro-tracking and pro-privacy interests caught in a tooth and nail battle over Do Not Track. In a Wired piece he describes an escalating "arms race" that threatens to topple the process and end in legislation. He says of post-cookie "fingerprinting" tech, "Browsers are gearing up to disable or reduce the effectiveness of such fingerprinting ... leading to yet another round of aggressive tracking tools by advertisers followed by blocking tools on the user side." His plea: Let's negotiate.

Predictive Analytics And A New Integration

 

Adobe is injecting predictive capabilities into its Adobe Social tool to help users boost engagement levels.

Mobile Ad Nets RIP?

 

Well, it may be an exaggeration to say that mobile ad networks are dead, but they certainly appear to be losing ground to social networks, according to an IDC report titled 2012 U.S. Mobile Advertising Market Sizing and Vendor Market Shares. (See the summary here <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001UXhBiAexZrd4MiOzCAaCNtf51zhZWVvqUi-OAY1WMnxpnIRcT57AKOgTEKHZ_AJsEHRHumusWHDL-mNfa4xp3LJUPrcTqpLDzmbakcKq0VAstpU344Qg7nuUsW-zumH7qxluqk8NeBAo5S-1f5maOzTT-h9cD4w9> .) Specifically, the space's former hegemons -- Google, Millennial Media and Apple -- are seeing pushback from publishers, apps and social networks, particularly Facebook, Pandora, Twitter and The Weather Channel, who are now taking the lion's share of mobile ad spend. "Networks, especially independent ones, are entering a difficult phase, in which, with an ever smaller share of revenue, they'll have to compete with publishers, which will only grow in strength," IDC's Karsten Weide tells Internet Retailer's Bill Siwicki.

Draining The Agency Brain

 

One recruiter speaking to the Financial Times believes digital talent can make 20-30% more salary in advertising than in tech, but that startup options tip the balance. Aegis CEO Nigel Morris, says this leaves agencies with "relatively few people who have a strong enough understanding of all the different emerging opportunities in digital, with a broad enough brand and business understanding in order to provide the strategic context under that." The end result is a perpetual knowledge drought in agency land.

Vibrant's Mobile Moves

 

Contextual player Vibrant Media is expanding into mobile, including images and text-based ads. Techcrunch's Anthony Ha suggests in-line ads on a touch screen might not be the fat-fingered man's nightmare they at first seem. "One of Vibrant's ad units only launches after users highlight a keyword through a three-second countdown, and Irvine said 4 percent of consumers actually do highlight the keyword long enough to activate the ad."

Microsoft Publishing

 

Microsoft Advertising - or is it Microsoft Publishing? - announced a new ad placement called VersaTiles for its popular email portal Outlook.com. Microsoft Advertising's Jennifer Creegan explains that the ad has three "states:" "Default state: Consumers see the Default state as they log in to Outlook.com. For example, an advertiser can choose to render displaying the tiles with their logo in the top tile and text with more information in the subsequent tiles; Hover state: Consumers can view more in-depth information and see additional images/information if they hover over the tiles; and Click state." See the example <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001_VkFk3W80g8QGEXs96wS8pM7xPyZofR3t7zlir4WlgltoUUX2R9iO-mrN2kEF-Is4JJTf-QfDuz4XlR8oDo8TcpEiH5_L4Ys7fwYEGqQKCZ27ODPN3vzxRJDadizRLHyzq3kxGxNDS3uv_HUY3P6Jn2JpTsIi4o3tz7UP-b-JclXj4k9Ldq06Yp3gaA252Ts-8Hd3-8R0pWPz9ej9S0RYU5GjzgN53BzirolmRZ2yGijhHytQy8GyO5qkLjxiB2uYeTQJbJtZ-k=> . Creegan explains in an email to AdExchanger that the ads are all first-party served - and no retargeting or CRM matching of email lists are allowed at this time. Microsoft wants brand budgets.

 

Mobile Ad Networks

Its secret: the two-year-old startup "wedged itself into the gaming world where it built an early platform for developers to trade advertising inventory," Cutler writes. Given that games "are the biggest category" for iOS and Android apps, this was "the ideal place to build a focused business."

Monitoring Brand Lift

 

The FT reviews Publicis' earnings from last week and notes imminent rollout of Publicis' own ad tech solution - Brand Live, "a monitoring technology that tracks activity on the web through blogs, social media and other traditional media. Publicis will licence this technology to third parties."

Is Publicis getting more into the ad tech ownership game, similar to WPP Group?

 

NYTimes.com Pulls Paywall On Videos

 

The NYTimes.com's metered paywall is being lifted - only for video, thanks to the ad support from Acura and Microsoft. Read the release <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001_VkFk3W80g944qnIRnrYBvCKnTXO54wjFOrw8fR5lhPm_KrbPP9QBHDz8Fm63D6C15T8PW1FloVV7d4W8_gwq1frSkaJIC4GZy1mtEbgLPbqRMVZQoAPEd38UGWqzCZu4TNfnbANp6FpgPb_zejJPN1gWRv-Zpq8k5YgThuo3EVJA9a_Aj6NvSbyJGHzaL2mxWyT2dtixPfTqf2f071ZRMnPvID38prK> . Denise Warren, EVP for the NYT's digital products and services group, tells paidContent's Jeff Roberts, "Part of the reason we're doing this is because we're already distributing on other channels like YouTube. Since it's already available [...] it seems inconsistent to keep it behind the gate."

Commoditizing Data

 

Ad serving, targeting and analytics represent "commoditized, low-hanging fruit" in the eyes of Andy Kahl, Evidon's director of data analysis. Speaking to AdAge's Kate Kaye, he voices concerns that the ease of this business may make big players complacent, ultimately stifling new creativity in the data space. "Innovation can only compete against a commodity when its unique value is understood - it's true for organic fruit, German-made sports cars, and now advertising technology," Kahl says.

Choice Words

 

Marketer Phil Fougere of audience targeting company Choicestream takes up the topic of agency trading desks (ATDs) in a company blog post. He writes, "The agencies would be foolish to stable such a cash cow. However, with the added pressure on ATDs from inside the agency as well as from clients and Ad Tech players (who've invented a better mouse-trap or come up with deeper analytics or audience insights), it seems only a matter of time before..."

Scarcity And RTB

 

According to ad trade The Drum, Xaxis UK Managing Director Nicolas Bidon discussed "how a publisher should approach real-time-bidding - focusing on the consumer and delivering fewer impressions" at a recent AdMonsters event. Bidon offered a use case from BSkyB: "The pay TV operator, which is one of the biggest spenders in RTB, recently revealed it now serves 15 percent fewer impressions year on year via RTB, while maintaining a flat budget, and has seen sales rise five percent as a result."

Surprising Search Spend

 

Kenshoo released its Q1 2013 Global Search Advertising Trends report, showing a 15% increase in global search ad spend for the quarter, compared to Q1 2012. Ad spend naturally dropped from the fourth quarter holiday season but continued on its year-over-year growth trend. The average cost-per-click in the US was $0.38, while global CTRs were up 62% year-over-year. Additionally, mobile devices accounted for 19% of clicks (10% from tablets and 9% from smartphones), but only 14% of ad spend, according to Kenshoo.

Souped-Up Facebook Photos

 

Images on Facebook's Timeline are about to become stickier. ThingLink, a startup that lets companies embed links, annotations, videos and purchase capabilities in images, has integrated its technology with Facebook, reports AdWeek's Mike Shields. "The bet is that users will be more inclined to share these souped-up images," Shields notes.

Bots And Ghouls, Cont.

 

On Adweek, Mike Shields wades again in the bot muck, outing properties and networks that appear to benefit from fraudulent traffic. Media6Degrees and RadiumOne alerted him to sites with large amounts of audience overlap - suggestive of bots. Mevio.com, Forward Health and 2Blue Media Group all make the list. Since February, "M6d has noticed 500-plus dicey new sites popping up on various exchanges-and collectively, 40.5 million bid requests."

Tumbling For Ads

 

The six-year-old microblog network is taking the latest in a small series of bows to the pressures of revenue generation with the launch of mobile ads on Tumblr's Apple iOS and Google Android apps. The move comes a year after the PC version of Tumblr rolled out "Radar" sponsored ad units. In an official blog post, Lee Brown, VP of sales for Tumblr, says of the mobile ads, "It works very simply: Every now and then you'll see posts from our partners as you scroll through your mobile Dashboard."

MarketShare's Predictive Funding

 

MarketShare, the predictive analytics player, raised a huge $38 million round to help promote the expansion of its existing technology. No word on whether that means acquiring outside companies or simply shoring up what it has in-house. LUMA Partners' Terence Kawaja and Brian Andersen served as advisors on the funding. Adam Hopkins, Managing Director at Elevation Partners, said in a statement, "We increased our investment because we think the team has nailed it, enabling marketing to be accountable for business results and manifesting itself in the form of rapid growth at the company."

Eyeballing Ads

 

Eye-tracking vendor Sticky is taking the question of whether or not consumers have seen an ad to a new level, reports MediaPost's Joe Mandese. Eye-tracking technology is not new, but what makes Sticky's approach compelling, Mandese notes, "is that it doesn't apply it in a laboratory or a resting facility, but in the real world, in real-time, while people are exposed to ads online."

Twitter's Big Ad Deal

 

Emily Steel breaks Twitter's new ad deal with Publicis in The FT. She writes, "The arrangement grants [Publicis' Starcom Media Group]'s clients, which include Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Microsoft and Coca-Cola, access to preferred advertising slots on Twitter, research and data, and new products, such as an 'In-tweet mobile survey' programme that will allow companies to poll consumers for real-time opinions."

Pivot of Yore

 

Fred Wilson on AV C writes an "angel's view" blog post about a bygone ad tech pivot, when behavioral ad pioneer Tacoda switched from a publisher to a network model: "TACODA closed a few big deals early on and got validation of the product and the market from that. But it got harder and harder" to close these $10,000-$20,000 per month deals. Three years later, Tacoda had crossed $50 million in revenues and Aol was writing a check for $275 million.

Algos As Editors

 

Roger Wood, founder of the (Art+Data) Institute, and Evelyn Robbrecht, a content design fellow at the Institute, co-authored a piece on paidContent, pointing to a recently developed algorithm at MIT "that can predict topics that will be trending on Twitter hours in advance. Similarly, startups such as Content Fleet and Parse.ly use algorithms to identify emerging popular topics on search engines. This way, a publisher will be able to create content with almost a certain return on investment."

AdBrite Inside

 

Five engineers from recently shuttered ad network/exchange AdBrite have re-emerged at Intel Media, reports All Things D's Peter Kafka.

Fraud Is The Advertiser's Problem

 

On Venture Beat over the weekend, Adometry CEO Paul Pellman delivered an op-ed on what needs to be done with ad fraud ASAP. Pellman writes, "Among our clients, which include large and small advertisers, agencies and ad networks, approximately 16 percent of monthly clicks are invalid (...) aided by sophisticated blocking lists that have been assembled to weed out known offenders over several years."

Yahoo Clears The Decks

 

Yahoo is shuttering a number of products you probably never heard of - Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts and Yahoo Kids - as the portal whittles its products down to what it thinks people will use. In a Yahoo blog post, EVP of Platforms Jay Rossiter writes, "We realize that change is hard, but by making tough decisions like these we can focus our energy on building beautiful products for you like the two we introduced this week - Yahoo! Mail for iPad and Android tablets and Yahoo! Weather for iPhone."

Levinsohn Explores Vevo

 

Guggenheim Digital, publisher of Billboard, The Hollywood Reporter and Adweek, is considering purchasing a stake in online music video joint venture Vevo, the WSJ's Keach Hagey reports. Run by ex-Yahoo ad sales head Ross Levinsohn, Guggenheim Digital is looking beyond the stable of trade titles to become a bigger entertainment and media player. To do so, Levinsohn has been handed "hundreds of millions" of dollars to go shopping, according to an unnamed source.

YouTube & Copyright

 

Like a court scene on repeat, Viacom again lost its copyright infringement case against YouTube. The US District Judge who first threw out the suit in 2010 "repeated his earlier ruling that YouTube's posting of...clips from Viacom series like The Daily Show fell under the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act," writes AdWeek's Sam Thielman. Viacom vows to appeal the ruling for a second time.

Shoppable Images

 

Online tag management company Stipple is going after the ecommerce market with its new tool, Stipple Shopping, which enables shoppers to purchase by clicking on an image without being redirected to another page or website. "We don't want to just provide information; we believe images are a platform for commerce," said Stipple CEO Ray Fleming. With Stipple Shopping, he added, brands will be able to "reach untapped audiences who were just looking at an image and are now buying it."

Omnicom Tech

 

Yesterday, Omnicom reported earnings of $200 million or so for Q1 2013 on revenue of $3.4 billion, showing "organic" growth of 2.9% year over year, says Pivotal's Brian Wieser.

From the earnings call transcript, Omnicom CEO addresses his company's "media tech" strategy (owning it vs. licensing it): "Because we're as big as we are, everyone comes knocking on our door and oftentimes ask[s] us to do 1 or 2 things: either partner with to make sure that what we believe the individual company will, in fact, turn out to be successful; or we have the ability to make an investment in it. We've elected to deal with quite a number of different platforms, not make a judgment as to whether or not it was a good financial investment because our primary interest is to service our clients."

Privacy Polls

 

With polls, it all depends on who is asking the questions. A new Digital Advertising Alliance study - the DAA supports industry self-regulation in privacy matters - finds that consumers want to be targeted! Adweek's Katy Bachmann covers the thousand-person poll: "Consumers actually prefer targeted ads with nearly 70 percent responding that they'd like at least some ads tailored directly to their interests, compared to only 16 percent that preferred to see randomly selected ads for products and services."

The Reprice Is Right

 

Kristopher Kubicki describes the shift to real-time price competition in a piece for AdAge. He notes that Amazon was among the first to start repricing products throughout the day, but others have quickly followed suit: "During the last holiday season, we at Dynamite Data detected up to a three-fold increase in the relative quantity of price changes over 2011 across major retailers." To protect ROI going forward, ad bidding systems will have to match those quick changes.

Microsoft Online Services Revs Rise

 

Despite some continued challenges with its PC and tablet product fronts, Microsoft had a pretty solid quarter overall, beating analysts' profit projections but missing on revenues, according to Tech Trader Daily's Tiernan Ray.

LinkedIn Adds Smartphone Ads

 

LinkedIn's overhaul of its mobile apps will, for the first time, allow the company to show ads to smartphone users, Reuters' Alexei Oreskovic reports. More than a quarter of LinkedIn's usage now comes from its mobile app, up from 15% one year ago, highlighting the value and the necessity of connecting marketers with consumers via phones. LinkedIn will begin showing ads within the mobile app's news stream as part of a "small test," LinkedIn rep Julie Inouye told Reuters.

IBM also reported its Q1 - and missed expectations. "Despite a solid start and good client demand we did not close a number of software and mainframe transactions that have moved into the second quarter," CEO Ginni Rometty said. The business analytics, containing what used to be Omniture and Unica, grew revenue by 7%.

Accordant Media has released results from a study of Q1 2012 real-time bidding (RTB) data seen through its ad buying platform. According to a release <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001Lz_Y9XKSoVG3Dh-ewJYiNccdnrjL7Ei80JhTGsGLUKP_MLrdvLRbaK6ra0Yl5HLLBnsRz7VFeKwM3GtDjwIXuZ0XhDAXIncSANMnEq0pb3nyqbQpmCIW3Rc79kcaC6FhMukRNoANLm0QSPD-TwDtqrO6mWVYqq-Imb6oxd0EvBpNXmfAmJLqKu3bKJiDEjKanrWBulzGo8wnh_otP-nSP5--USEb0QkbfSh6iA-T8D0M4ILc-2IzE39NqOR5BZSzXHbEESAuFBP-9x5R3q7hRCrogFycj0Bh3I8txPhLhxN8hQI075iPOlXZ0vvMt66G> , "Ad placement transparency improved significantly from 32% to 41%" - which seems to mean that Accordant could see the URL/publisher for the placement it was bidding on.

Twitter product manager Nippon Malhotra writes, "Users won't see any difference in their use of Twitter - we're not showing ads more frequently in timelines, and users can still dismiss Promoted Tweets they don't find relevant." I wonder if this means people will be tweeting "I want a Starbucks coupon" in hopes of a freebie.

The Cookie Crumbles

 

All the talk about Mozilla Firefox joining Microsoft's IE browser in blocking tracking cookies by default has got some in the industry intensely worried about the continued growth. But Lotame COO Adam Lehman says not to worry. Writing in Digiday, he says, "Turning off the Firefox third-party spigot will only represent a 15-20 percent reduction in the available third-party data from Web-based sources. Taking a broader view, as the Firefox door closes, a hundred new doors will be opening (or at least a few new doors with a hundred times the data)."

AdX Private Auctions

 

Google is letting DoubleClick publishers set up private auctions "directly above the open auction." The new offering, which follows the launch of preferred deals last year, lets a display ad seller give "first look" access to select bidders - for instance, a handful of agency trading desks. On the buy side it's available to all, including Google's own DoubleClick Bid Manager (née Invite Media).

Ad Network Buys A Rival

 

If you can't beat 'em, buy 'em. Video ad network Alloy, fresh from banking a $30 million funding round, has acquired its similarly youth-focused rival DBG. "With the added muscle of DBG's impressive video and CLiP platform, we are further realizing a vision for delivering compelling content directly to both consumers and advertisers and effectively monetizing the value of our top content brands in a new media world," said Matt Diamond, CEO of Alloy Digital.

Is that display spend or mobile spend? According to the IAB, it's a mobile spend - despite it being a display ad. The same is true if you see a search ad on mobile. Despite you having done an actual search, resulting in a search ad, the IAB considers that spend to be a mobile spend."

Targeting Exhilaration

 

Social and mobile ad startup MediaBrix bets that serving ads to game players while they are basking in the glow of a high score will yield higher engagement levels. A new product, Rewards, lets brands send players a coupon or other messages when they achieve some in-game milestone, such as a new level. "Rewards produces powerful emotional connections and creates lasting impressions for a brand," claims CRO Todd Bowman.

Publishers' Creative QA

 

In his publication, AdMonsters' Rob Beeler delivers the results of a study on creative QA and the publisher. Beeler writes, "While almost every publisher reviews creative look and functionality, fewer had a sufficient built-in process for the other things that come through a third party tag: namely malvertising and tracking pixels."

Weather, Beer, Ads

 

The term "weather targeting" is bandied about with some frequency, but its meaning can seem a little...foggy. Is it more than predictive umbrella peddling? Digiday shares findings from The Weather Company that suggests media buyers should indeed watch the skies. For instance, in Chicago, "Four consecutive days of below-average summer temperatures will spike beer sales by 20%." Atlanta has its own weather-to-beer quirks. Read it. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001pEwk2B0qy0p5ivwLRtSPnihuULLCv7mANJpAOKL3qbaqetx6s92ER2CcgOIGJ9MDBh0jPmrfQ6SPZ6Aem4JlCXw9-bOAE3jx5wnL0q254p0LZ-Tv7Ske25qg-yzHbLQICfrrZxqudRcG3w-ruRPhjEouRqKCQsZPLEgY7sQwy_w=> 

 

Mapping Credit Card Data

 

Credit card companies are increasingly selling transactional information to data firms, generating new revenue streams and potentially raising privacy alarms. AdAge's Kate Kaye covers a few examples: "Using the Mastercard data, a burger or pizza chain might use the system to push promotions to neighborhoods in which people spend more than the average at fast-food joints." Zip+4 targeting and vague audience segments (e.g. "frequent transactors") seem to be the rule here.

Commodity Markets

 

Jeff Green of demand-side platform The Trade Desk revisits the difference between financial and ad markets in a piece on MediaPost. He relates this anecdote: "I was given a stark reminder of online advertising's often singular place in the commodities market after speaking with a Ph.D. student who...had been studying the habits of corn pricing on commodities markets. He informed me that there were essentially over 125 variables that make up the value of corn. With human behavior in the equation there are virtually an infinite number of variables."

Slow Growth At Agency

 

On Monday, agency holding company Publicis reported less-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter of 2013. Read more on Bloomberg <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001pEwk2B0qy0pghhO_IuhvJNC60wdbTvut5vQNBtfhMzYMgUrG85W8E9nqbQiVw2_4vCtMCnaRlVhB_wtDTS-ywPm9t9RBydTfJycfVfjce8vWC3lKgMm8K5LXy4MusnF87WjNtX9j_q-ucTxra8t3Fwoak6HCPRocIH72XB-qFUPGyb5XEEwwmKn7R7X2pYZVqBt7LSlRVtKuNSamoZDubbICDgQyUkDzqTm5EQ2KfiI=> . Nevertheless, BMO analyst Dan Salmon notes, "A strong quarter of net new business ($2.1B vs. $800 mn in 1Q12) gives management confidence in the back half of the year. Overall, we take a wait-and-see approach ahead of the analyst day on April 23 in London, where we can get more detail on management's efforts to reach its 2013 organic growth target of 3.2%-3.6%."

 

Cookie Crumbling

 

In Adweek, Tim Peterson investigates the demise of the third-party cookie and listens to a variety of industry voices. Acxiom's Geoff Amborn tells Peterson, "In a cookieless world, publishers with business models that naturally collect strong names and addresses and other personally identifiable information are going to be able to...connect into CRM databases. For publishers that have a weak PII story, they've been more heavily reliant on the cookie world." Trouble ahead for some - perhaps the "long tail?"

$egmenting Audience

 

Real-time bidding company Turn has released a new report showing that costs for display advertising, video ads and other rich media are increasing, while those for mobile and social ads have fallen, according to TechCrunch's Anthony Ha. Noting a Turn audience segment called the "digital elite," Ha writes, "Turn says it's the report's 'biggest discovery' - a particularly desirable audience that includes 2 percent of consumers. They see 24 times more ads than the average consumer, and advertisers pay eCPMs that are 85 percent higher than average to reach this audience."

Shady Business

 

Relying on the advertising industry's version of a "bake-off" - pitting vendors against each other to find the best one - carries several pitfalls, reports AdAge's Jason Del Ray. Marketers or agencies should be on the lookout for "loopholes that allow firms to game them," Del Ray writes. One example is the vendor that slashes its profits in the trial to get a prospective client's business. "The problem here is obvious," Del Ray notes. "Once they win the business, they will need to make a profit and will have to change tactics to do so."

People, Come Together

 

Brands, publishers and ad platforms need to stop talking at cross purposes, John Battelle writes for AdAge. The core problems he raises are familiar: disagreement over what to measure, an unwillingness to "get to know the other side," the role publisher context should play in the media plan, incompatible incentives. Battelle calls for "a longer-term vision than the next click, the last attribution, the successful exit or the highest CPM."

Hearst's PubMatic, Programmatic Tour

The tour offers an under-the-hood look at the partnership's private exchange, which was rolled out last June, to see how much more valuable inventory can be plugged into the Audience Exchange - as the Hearst/PubMatic system is called - without cannibalizing the publisher's direct sales. "Programmatic creates a platform that allows us to do more with our marketing partners, not less," CRO Kristine Welker told Digiday's Josh Sternberg.

The Ultimate Disconnect

 

About three years ago, Google engineer Brian Kennish had a change of heart over helping the search giant collect user data. Kennish formed Disconnect.me to block Facebook from using "Likes" and other tools to suck up member data. Disconnect.me is now expanding its anti-Facebook data collection system to cover platforms run byTwitter, Yahoo! and his former employer Google. In an interview, Kennish tells paidContent's Jeff John Roberts, "The company is at work on tools to limit the spread of data from mobile devices" and create education around privacy issues.

Children's Privacy Timeout

 

The Interactive Advertising Bureau has filed a request with the FTC to delay implementation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by six months, arguing that the guidelines, which cover a range of activities by websites aimed at kids, are incredibly complex and difficult to implement easily. "It's a complete makeover and that will take time," Mike Zaneis, the IAB's SVP and General Counsel, told Adweek's Katy Bachman.

Trust In Google

 

The European Union has extracted concessions out of Google as it relates to its anti-trust investigation. The Financial Times reported over the weekend, "The US internet giant will revamp its results page to include prominent links to rival search engines and clearer signposts for its own in-house services." But, is that a big deal? The FT says it could have been a lot worse for GOOG.

Display Yesterday & Today

 

On Digiday, Brian Morrissey finds that the first display ads were a branding play -- not direct response. Joe McCambley, former creative director at Modem Media who worked on the ad for AT&T, said of the experience, "We believed if we could create something useful, we could be successful..."

Acqui-Apply

 

The MIT grads who formed the mobile/geo-location activity tracking startup Bahavio have decided to pack up the shop and join Google, Techcrunch's Frederic Lardinois reports. It's not an acqui-hire or an acquisition. The guys just decided to take a job with Google and quit their project. Behavio said in a release, "We believe that our digital experiences should be better connected with the way we experience the world, and we couldn't be happier to be able to continue building out our vision within Google."

Cro-mobile Man

 

Naveen Tewari, CEO at mobile ad network InMobi, tells Clickz's Matt Kapko how the evolution of the mobile experience will play out: "I would say creative is ahead, tracking is catching up, and targeting is something which the promise is very visible, but because of a few of these infrastructural pieces around common IDs, etc., there is still some distance to go."

I Am An Ad Network

 

Joe Mandese reveals the content of a recent fireside chat with Netmining CEO Chris Hansen on MediaPost. Mandese observes, "[Hansen] was crystal clear and incredibly simple in his description. 'We're an ad network,' he said candidly. That impressed me, because it's one of those things most ad tech players avoid comparing themselves to. I'm not sure exactly why, but the term 'ad network' has become a pejorative."

Billions Of Digital Pounds

 

Digital spend is on the upswing everywhere. The IAB in the UK chimes in on its region in a new report, "Just as digital spend crossed the £5 billion mark in 2012, mobile spend reached its own half billion pound milestone. Fuelled by smartphone ownership hitting almost two-thirds (64%) of the UK population in December 2012, mobile advertising grew like-for-like by 148% to £526.0 million in 2012 from £203.2 million in 2011."

Hiring Now

 

The U.S. tech industry is increasingly throwing its weight behind the immigration process, observes New York Times reporter Somini Sengupta, "Rarely has the industry been so single-mindedly focused on a national policy issue (...)," Sengupta writes.

Mobile Intent Data

 

A survey released at the IAB's Mobile conference looking at how smartphone users interact with their finances (you did remember to file your taxes, didn't you?) finds that nearly two out of three respondents (58%) regularly use their bank's mobile app, while another 25% are aware of the app, but have yet to use it. What are they waiting for? "Most financial apps already contain rock-solid security, but consumers seem not to be as plugged into that fact," said Anna Bager, head of the IAB's mobile marketing center of excellence. And of course, more financial intent will be captured on mobile devices.

Programmatic Overhaul

 

Undertone's Eric Franchi calls for publishers to "clean up the clutter" in programmatic advertising on The Guardian. "This oversupply of ad inventory - fuelled by the programmatic era - is not only exceeding publishers' ability to sell, it is arguably leading digital advertising into a dark age," Franchi argues. One solution, according to Franchi, is to reduce the number of ads on pages and make the remaining ones bigger.

Video Coupon Clips

 

Mobile coupons got a lot of attention two years ago, when the likes of Google and the Associated Press began producing virtual circulars for smartphones. But things quieted down as mobile ad spending continued along its fast, if diffuse, growth patterns. Now, the WSJ and Fox News, both News Corp. properties, are turning to mDialog to produce mobile video coupons as a way to build up rich media and smartphone placements. "It's an opportunity to fill inventory in a creative way," Jeff Misenti, chief digital officer for Fox News Digital, told Adweek's Christopher Heine.

People who use mobile IM/chat apps are 30% more likely to be interested in receiving ads on their phone, according to data pulled from a new Experian database. The Simmons Connect database contains a trove of behavioral information from 25,000 US adults who agreed to have measurement apps installed on their smartphones, tablets, and computers, as well as consumer data from TVs, radio, magazines, newspapers, gaming consoles, and MP3 players. Marketers and agencies can use the data to "understand with greater detail the behaviors of their custom-defined consumer target," Experian claims.

The Trading Desk Conundrum

 

The party might be over for agency trading desks, writes AdWeek's Mike Shields as he examines the controversy surrounding the usefulness of independent trading desks. The debate, according to Shields, centers on "whether the agency holding company should decentralize its trading desk practices as programmatic ad buying grows in importance, or continue to house them in a stand-alone entity with its own profit and loss structure."

Social + In-Market

 

Facebook is adding new offline purchase data from Acxiom, Datalogix, and Epsilon. Advertisers can now target people who buy lots of frozen veggies, for instance, or children's cereal. They can pluck these segments from Facebook's self-serve interface, alongside its own social data.

It's just the latest move in a sustained effort by Facebook to absorb the methods pioneered in traditional display over the past decade.

 

Video Ad Tussle

 

Do TV buyers care about online ads? Digiday's Jack Marshall looks at online video advertising and says, "There are (...) tensions on the agency side, of which sellers should be wary. Despite [Group M exec Ari] Bluman's comments, a tussle for 'ownership' of online video continues in some media-buying organizations. At some, online video has been taken away from digital buyers completely, and handed to a centralized 'video' buying team that handles TV, too."

Mysterious Ads

 

Ars Technica's Nate Anderson unravels the banner ad mystery in which ads showed up on high profile websites like Apple.com and Bing.com. "It suggested that companies felt free to operate as a 'man in the middle,'" writes Anderson, "one free to inject code of their own choosing into webpage requests that were-so users believed-simply between themselves and the websites they were trying to reach."

Ad Tech Is Over

 

On Ad Age, Turn CEO Bill Demas says ad tech is over. Sort of. He writes in an op-ed, "Marketers have embraced technology. But they are demanding transparency, clarity and ROI, and instead what they often get from the industry is jargon and bickering over metrics and strategies. It's time we move beyond the ad-tech swordfight and get to a mature position where enterprise technology shapes the future of marketing."

Voluntary Ads

 

PaidContent's Jeff John Roberts covers some comments Google ad chief Susan Wojicki made at Ad Tech this week. The gist: people should have a hand in the marketing content they see, whether in the context of search, video, or presumably, display. "We're moving to a model where the user is choosing to see the ads." She added 70% of YouTube videos are now TrueView, meaning the buyer only pays when the ad is viewed.

Google: Phone Home?

Technically, he's not sure what Google could do to extinguish Facebook Home, but Greenfield does sense an incipient threat: While there is no advertising within the Facebook Home product today, we believe it is only a matter of time until it happens... If Google felt that Facebook spamming the Android home/lock screen with advertising is not in the best interests of Google/Android, why would it not try to stop these type of installs?"

Yahoo Bids For Brody


Yahoo is trying to poach AOL's Ned Brody to a North America sales leadership role - or so little birds tell Kara Swisher. If true it's a surprise move, since Brody is not a traditional sales guy -- having been instrumental in building the AOL Networks (formerly Ad.com) platform strategy. Is Yahoo finally rising to the programmatic challenge? If so... it's legally complicated. "Because Brody has a 12-month, non-compete agreement with AOL that the Silicon Valley Internet giant, as part of the deal it is close to striking with him, will pay him to not work in that period." Swisher hears Brody may already have stepped down from AOL.

TripAdvisor Buys Gilt's Jetsetter

 

After a relatively quiet few years as the online travel space heated up around it, hotel and accommodations reviews site TripAdvisor has bought hotel bookings site Jetsetter from luxury deals purveyor Gilt Groupe, reports Skift's Dennis Schaal.

If there was translated ad copy available, it was used where it made the most sense... we split up the task of creating new ad plans for each language and matching the appropriate languages to each country."

Slow Programmatic

 

Yesterday at AdExchanger's Programmatic I/O conference, eBay's head of digital display said programmatic needs to be less about real-time. As reported by Forbes' Robert Hof, Stephen Howard-Sarin said, "The marketer needs to know, how long does it take for someone to buy a product? That period of time obviously changes between a cup of coffee and a car. In programmatic, we tend to narrow that to the next few milliseconds. We need to move people along during the entire span." More. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001EQfsaLxnqoJYILdNIdxN7heB3zqjAHw_VDSouS14zFDxH7QqixSxm-bQWdn6OtVyt-3Y4PmGbGG3dyNnc0S9dmErE7gys0Ak5sVEkNyrIYxHNNzmER1NNQ9BmbhZKwnlKtc1NAEUkFV023f1DItp41Hh7ZcIMn75jRt3qM_foqHF4q53Il0QYXp78imy1TaIcprHisi6d6ERjxBwpTsEzvusVHAyJ-KGUNjXxymN_dI=>  Forbes also covered the "cookie armageddon" angle from Programmatic I/O.

Video RTB Rises

 

Forrester Research forecasts RTB spend for online video ads will reach $1.14 billion by 2014, in a study commissioned by SpotXchange, making up 24.7% of US online video ad spend that year. Forrester used its online video ad spend forecasts, along with interviews with online video buyers, sellers, and publishers, to calculate its video RTB forecast. The study highlights how online video is supplementing traditional TV campaigns and how programmatic buying mechanisms will not only grow, but also diversify. The bad news, notes <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001EQfsaLxnqoIAfvCx6zgycO2yIM9UigP5_ilomDwseA_BtV626WJZAxbgxht3HMLLrspGVQy5dkm5cV0F06-f4AdgZXy3IvR1a08EUVUToy7rf9gV1rIpYnBTwNDpRWYv1O7eb8nCO7dP34FmVe0FzFWSxUS60_oxN8i2HpHxePkP4MrFn0iw6tZQYEeIl6f98ljAzOE6t2AsEk5lXnHFTTqyE78RLm73MYXHhX9CfXiHMJwm3OMW1g==>  Paid Content's Jeff John Roberts, is that video ad prices are under pressure. "The word is out about video's promise," Roberts writes, "and more and more people are showing up to grab a slice of the pie."

Yahoo's Albatross

 

The New York Times' Jenna Wortham and Nicole Perlroth lay out the challenges Marissa Mayer must overcome to inject fresh startup blood into Yahoo. "If you are a quality start-up, Yahoo is still not the place to be," Colin Gillis, an Internet analyst at BGC Partners, tells The New York Times. "It's hardly your first pick."

More Money, Less Problems

 

Media consultant and blogger Dorian Benkoil takes a look at how the programmatic space is dealing with fraud and privacy issues these days. He's noticed signs of progress. And that progress can be measured in dollar flows. "It's a sure bet that the predictions of increased dollars flowing through exchanges are correct, and that more sophisticated technologies will emerge," Benkoil writes on PBS' MediaShift.

Adapting To Nielsen OCR

 

Adap.tv has signed on to use Nielsen's Online Campaign Ratings, which aims to measure the reach of video ad campaigns across screens. The video ad platform hopes to show it can tackle issues of price, quality/engagement and above all, a clear set of measurements. But will it kill or enhance the GRP? Judging from what Adap.tv is saying, it's hoping for the latter as it launches the offering in the UK. "The key to driving widespread adoption of online video is to ensure that digital can speak a language to which TV buyers can relate," says Adap.tv's Brian Fitzpatrick in a release.

Attention-Getting

 

Celtra, a rich media mobile ad server and analytics provider, says its AdCreator software now incorporates enhanced video reporting. "Advertisers are keen to know which parts of their videos are the most interesting to viewers and conversely, where any drop-off happens," said Matevz Klanjsek, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer of Celtra.

Data for Everyone

 

Visual Revenue, a predictive analytics platform for news editors, makes a case for why audience data is just as essential for editors as it is for advertisers. "Advertisers have long since...bought into data," writes Visual Revenue's Rich Ullman in a blog post "and they are using it so aggressively through exchanges and programmatic buying that they are squeezing every last ounce from publishers. This imbalance must be addressed, and it can only happen with a combination of data-driven thinking and distinctive editorial voices."

The Neal Mohan Story

 

In a feature article on Business Insider, Nicholas Carlson recounts Neal Mohan's rise to the Google display ad management throne. Carlson says that Mohan has had offers from competitors to run their companies, but still he remains firmly at the GOOG. Invite Media (acquired by Google in 2010 <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0016lrV6NoQ30idyFPTeRGfWuQAPfUc-CH5WgMI-3oLmHW0JJhn8S1rJlTKPscgN5BSrCAEJkih2f87sgG7QGPt124tFhY1-nLEEKqpghYucf2RSRdHmLz-g7QSFYytZozxL97-jxdZYSSpZJerpfxiiNdkAPp-NbUmx2tnxOxD9jE=> ) founder Nat Turner reasons why: "If he had another display guy above him, or if there were political nonsense going on, he would probably take off sooner. But there isn't."

Cross-Device Opt-Outs

 

Drawbridge is one of the more buzzed about vendors in the cross-device data collection space (along with Adelphic Mobile, TapAd, and AdTruth). The company last week set up a deal to support tracking opt-outs through TRUSTe's mobile ad privacy program. Press release <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0016lrV6NoQ30h29FpyRJyDQjkAVPPVv0wG8mkUbgbi7rFQ-rFrbMK47OfITaHXEV9_0ID5_uw7Ppn-XkWsOOr0yyQQ7eQ_ggDn8LvdjBDsjNdkAY5bBW2L9933DPmit70nSSNjzWf59mkx1DlsPERMPXdVJLK6XvWT> . Drawbridge CEO Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnancited TRUSTe's compliance with the EU Safe Harbor standard as a reason for the pairing. Global privacy compliance is "key to our global client business" she said in a statement. The question remains, will regulators and privacy advocates accept industry-administered privacy systems for so-called device "fingerprinting" technology?

Retargeting Exposed

 

IMedia's Dax Hamman takes site retargeting apart to show that it is "there to plug the leaks from our marketing funnels, and stick a Band-Aid on what is broken." Marketers, Hamman continues, need to "understand what [site retargeting] really is, find a smarter way to measure it, and break your reliance for it."

Measuring 'Walk-Throughs'

 

PlaceIQ is offering a new metric for mobile ads that's essentially a real-world equivalent of the online "view-through." The so-called "Place Visit Rate" is defined thusly: "The ratio of people who viewed mobile ads for a physical retailer and subsequently were observed in that store."

The Multichannel Challenge

 

The good news is internet traffic from smart TVs and set top boxes is rising alongside traffic from tablets and smartphones. The bad news is companies must work even harder to reach consumers, reports Broadband TV News, which cites findings from the Netbiscuits quarterly web trends report. "This evidence creates a serious challenge for brands, as more devices come in numerous different technologies, sizes and configurations. Without adopting a fully future-proofed multi-channel approach, companies risk falling behind and ultimately wasting money and losing consumers," said Netbiscuits CEO Michael Neidhoefer.

Local Yokel

 

Are there fumes left to burn in the local ad network gas tank? Local.com apparently thinks so, having launched a new "premium" network of newspaper sites and other locally focused properties to capture national ad spend. Greg Sterling notes on his Screenwerk blog, "This is almost exactly the same value proposition of the former Real Cities, which was owned by McClatchy, Gannett and Tribune Co. and was one of the first attempts at a national-local premium ad network." Centro bought and eventually shut down Real Cities. Unrelated but related: the sails also seem to have gone slack in Yahoo's Newspaper Consortium.

NYT Friendly Takeover

 

The NYTimes.com has long been trumpeting its custom homepage ads as a solution to the problem of attracting brand advertising akin to the expensive ads in its daily newspaper and weekly Sunday magazine. The latest is a front-page ad takeover for insurer Prudential that lets users see an image of NYT front page of the day they were born, which caught the eye of Adweek's Lucia Moses. "While the Times has been praised for taking an innovative approach to advertising-especially for such a traditional publication-these kinds of initiatives may well invite backlash from editorial purists who would bristle at the mingling of editorial and advertising," she opines.

SinglePlatform Gets Yelped

 

Unlike politics, all online advertising isn't local, but proximity is important for certain publishers. Take reviews site Yelp, for example, which has signed on with business listings publisher network -- and Constant Contact acquisition -- SinglePlatform. "We didn't feel like we were quite ready yet with our publisher network, and our business wasn't quite ready to scale," Wiley Cerilli, SP's founder and now-VP at Constant Contact, told Street Fight's Steven Jacobs. "But you're going to start to see a lot more combined marketing efforts from the two companies."

Now, he thinks it's time to clean house and stop using the term "native advertising" as well. "Everything from 'product placement' to sponsored tweets to 'anything that's not a banner' has been unceremoniously dumped in the Native Advertising hopper... Yes, it's definitely time to click on 'Empty Native Advertising Bin' and start over," Weaver writes.

Commerce Adding Offline To Online

 

J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth shares his notes about eBay's recent analyst day. He calls eBay "the next generation of commerce featuring the convergence of online and offline shopping, and significant impact from mobile devices."

About-Face for Facebook?

 

AdAge's Cotton Delo wonders if Facebook's willingness to push News Feed ad inventory into Facebook Exchange means it is sacrificing its high ideals. "Social context is now an ingredient in Facebook's marketing recipe instead of being the whole meal." Delo writes.

The Do-It-All E-Commerce Brand

 

More online retailers are bringing the supply chain in-house, morphing into manufacturing and distribution giants. New York Times examines the trend, noting some brands zig where others zag. "In some cases, the online brands are choosing not to discount, keeping the extra profits from cutting out the middlemen for themselves." The marketing implications only grow as browsing and purchase data increasingly inform areas like R&D and pricing.

Patents And Mobile Targeting

 

On MediaPost, Laurie Sullivan covers patents that she says were approved by the U.S. Patent Office for Yahoo recently.

Premium, Publishers, Programmatic...

 

Ever since private marketplaces/private exchanges arrived on the programmatic scene two years ago as a way for publishers to feel more comfortable about real-time bidding, there's been a lot of speculation about their value. But some buyers approve of the model, suggesting they're seeing the benefits as well. "Premium publishers should go about their monetization strategy through a combination of private marketplace and programmatic reserve," said Brian Lesser, CEO of WPP's agency trading desk Xaxis, tells Adweek's Tim Peterson. "We're not going to encourage a premium publisher to participate in open exchanges because it devalues the inventory and doesn't provide control of what advertisers go up against their content."

Phablets Are a 'Phad'

 

There's no point trying to walk the middle ground sometimes, particularly if you're a device whose description falls between a tablet and a smartphone. Mobile analytics provider Flurry looks at usage and finds that "phablets," as it calls these in-betweens (Samsung's Galaxy Note is the chief example), hardly registers when it comes to app usage. "The 'Is it a phone or is it a tablet' devices otherwise known as phablets have attracted interest, but currently command a relatively small share (2%) of the device installed base, and their share of active users and sessions is also relatively small," Flurry's report says. Read it <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001i_yYjQgN0dnPqVH5_YZwXWfXhnyam3ZA9213_u3xFGcceha5uklQNqXgb6H4JSt_zAbWHBnM5xiqvkC_O89gFi_ZeZxsEf0d6YF8fxehUf1CpqvrmEcN48v1lPLm2vy27h7jcZt0LSOh2TyfWGUXMGTyhMj-NXb_TpSeZo9LGlq07lIJgmO1cwu5IWydl0nnzZMEZc828vQ=> .

 

The Facebook Phone

 

On the desktop Internet, Facebook has been called "a better cookie." If the company is close to launching its own phone, as reports indicate, it begs the question what advantage (targeting or otherwise) does "owning the smartphone" create? There may be potential to renew its fading claim on consumer app usage. But that's only if people buy the thing. As Jan Dawson, a telco analyst at Ovum, tells The New York Times, "There are lots of people who love Facebook, but I doubt if any of them feel like they need a more Facebook-centric experience on their phones. There isn't anything obviously missing."

The Bottle And The Data Genie

 

In a piece on web privacy in the New York Times' Sunday edition, behavioral economist Alessandro Acquisti from Carnegie Mellon University tells the NYT in a series of anecdotes, studies and statements that consumers don't undestand whats happening with their data on the Web. Acquisti reasons, "I reveal my date of birth and hometown on my Facebook profile and an identity thief can reconstruct my Social Security number and steal my identity, or someone can send me 'happy birthday' messages on the day of my birthday, which makes me feel very good."

Mobile Insights

 

Venture Beat's Rakesh Agrawal called on four brands (Pandora, The Weather Channel, Sephora, Trulia) to weigh in on the mobile ad monetization challenge. "There are still too many buyers focused on clicks," Alex Linde, VP of digital and mobile apps at The Weather Channel, tells Agrawal. To uncover the "true ROI of mobile" Linde continues, agencies must connect all their metrics "across screens."

Facebook+Android

 

Speculation is mounting as to what Facebook will unveil next week after inviting the press to "Come See Our New Home On Android." TechCrunch's Josh Constine notes that the "evidence aligns to say this is the Facebook Phone announcement people have been speculating about for years." Other rumors include a beefed up application layer and a Facebook-themed homescreen.

Ad-Free Zones?

 

Selling ads for a small-to medium site isn't as easy as it seems, and some publishers are opting for simple paywalls and donations in lieu of ad support. AdAge's Matt Creamer does an informal survey that includes media news maven Jim Romenesko, who concedes that his work is now a "retirement hobby," and has relied on donations and Google AdSense. Others like Lisa Hickey, CEO of Good Men Media, which runs opinion pieces about the state of manhood, was disillusioned after hitting 1 million monthly uniques and seeing little return. "The CPMs slowly go down [on banner ads]," she says. "The number of ads we have to put on the site to break even goes up. It's a balancing act that doesn't get us to where we need to go."

Reddit Relevance

 

Reddit, that online volcano of meme-spewing activity, appears to be less and less of a digital trendsetter. PandoDaily's David Holmes, citing an academic study <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001LnCisKN9bPa6CBxZP8qczkU-wY69DYJCxQExK5hVUxvbemH7YnlGPgkWGx8Ka6mxkHQvQCbqaKdVa9Z2l-MOdGYbG-O35YEe603tyoozgXHEd3hkYrfr36XyBZ5ZffgZff2LPm0G1Z0LUilrFwLRoH7i6pFyFSUrp8dAVXlA-6c=>  that says more than half of Reddit's front page links have circulated elsewhere before, suggesting a burgeoning relevance problem. And it's something that should give social media marketers pause, as Holmes observes: "Unless you reward users for sharing content, they'll be nothing more than passive content consumers. And without engaging in your community, don't be surprised when they switch loyalties at the drop of a hat."

DMP Gets Loan

 

Data management platform Lotame has perhaps decided it doesn't want to give away any more equity - at least, for now. The company has entered into a "venture loan" agreement with Horizon Technology Finance for a $5.5 million loan. According to the release, "Lotame plans to strengthen global initiatives across five continents, and make key hiring decisions to expand the sales, technology, and executive teams."
