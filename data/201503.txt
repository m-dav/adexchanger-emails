 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

For Publishers, It’s Scale Fast Or Own Your Niche 

Mid-size publishers are being forced to compete with the scale of digital powerhouses or package their audience through programmatic channels, driving down the value of their inventory. “The number one issue for publishers is scale,” Yieldbot chief Jon Mendez tells the WSJ’s Mike Shields <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPlg0Xq0AD00B4Y020W0> . “Hearst’s competition isn’t Meredith. It’s Google, Facebook and Twitter.” Ironically, the issue may be more severe for larger publishers than for those with a smaller, focused audience. Skift, which covers the travel business, provides value to advertisers because, in the words of CEO Rafat Ali, they “know so much more about [their] audience in a way that giants don’t.” Meanwhile, The Economist, Reuters, CNN International, The Guardian and the Financial Times are banding together to eke value out of their broader audiences. (AdExchanger story <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00Xh0ALAWPZlB02q000> ) 

Because Programmatic’s Worth It 

French cosmetics giant L’Oréal is ready to try on automation. "We all know that programmatic is going to be a big shift in the way we buy media," L’Oréal Chief Digital Officer Lubomira Rochet told Ad Age. "In terms of the underlying technologies, it's like a matrix. We'll go through a lot of test and learn in the coming months, so we can prove models to see what's best for L'Oreal in terms of technology, governance, setup and everything." One of those options is creating an in-house programmatic unit, à la rival marketer Procter & Gamble. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0P0B00000AX4Dq02lWi0>  

Xaxis Buys Into Apps 

Xaxis keeps buying ad tech. The WPP-owned programmatic hub snapped up ActionX, a specialist in mobile app and cross-screen ads. ActionX’s tech will be integrated into Xaxis to support deep linking and custom messaging to mobile users. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/AX0104WB200AlPq00L0j0DA> . Read AdExchanger’s previous coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP0020kL0XW00AD2q0lA04>  of ActionX’s multiscreen retargeting tech. Last year, Xaxis bought Euro ad net BannerConnect <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0lqW0D003AlB0X4PA> . 

Mobile Budgets Rising 

Adweek reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0l0mWD0L4P40A2q0X0BA00>  that though mobile marketers see the value of transacting programmatically, the adoption of automation is lagging. Seventy-six percent of mobile marketers agree that mobile programmatic is important, but only 27% of the 200 executives polled have actually purchased mobile ads programmatically, according to the IAB. But in its 2015 “Marketer Perceptions of Mobile Advertising” report, released Monday, the IAB also says that 9% of those surveyed increased their mobile budgets over the past two years by more than 50%, and 65% are spending more on mobile today than in 2012. 

Spotlight On Video 

UK publishers are enjoying a 20% boost in revenue from online video, according to the Association of Online Publishers and Deloitte’s Q4 Digital Publisher Revenue Index Report. The percentage increase is far above the previous quarter’s 3.4% growth in online video. “Publishers continue to embrace online video as a platform and they are being rewarded with strong growth figures,” said Deloitte’s Howard Davies. “Research suggests it’s proven to be effective in shifting consumer perception and brands are responding to that.” The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPln4B00W000qAX0020A5D> .

Mobile Video Heats Up 

Operaworks Media CEO Mahi de Silva tells Beet.TV that mobile video revenue grew from 9% of the firm’s total revenue in 2013 to over 50% last year. “Mobile video is clearly the fastest-growth segment within mobile advertising,” he said. “We’re seeing that consumers really engage with [mobile] video. We get to see engagement rates [and] completion rates in the high 80 or 90th percentile, whereas on desktop it’s a fraction of that.” Watch the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLXWp0APl7020qD40> . 

Algo Vs. Algo 

DSP Choicestream has rolled out a new optimization approach. The platform “lets the algorithms duke it out in the arena and see who wins,” ChoiceStream CEO Eric Bosco tells AdExchanger. He adds, “There are a lot of parallels between trading algorithms in advertising and finance. In finance, they have six different ways to figure out which way the stock went, up or down. They run it on Tuesday, check the results on Wednesday, and use it to predict on Thursday.” The finance analogy for ads: not dead!

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Mining The Video 

Reuters’ Malathi Nayak reports that Verizon is mulling free video packages. Though yet to be confirmed, Verizon CFO Fran Shammo says <http://go.adexchanger.com/ifPW00BlPFL00A000Dq2A04>  the company is considering an “‘advertising-type’ model, ‘not necessarily a consumer-pay model.’” The service, which is set to release this year, will also include original programming from outlets like Dreamworks and Verizon’s own Awesomeness TV. Shammo adds that Verizon sees online video as a way “to increase data consumption on mobile devices and increase revenue.” 

For Google, Mobile Is Prismatic 

Google dominates the search game, but mobile has rewritten that game’s rules. “Smartphone users spend most of their time in apps rather than browsing the Web, and they conduct fewer searches than personal-computer users,” notes the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0GP0Ll0DB0g0W0q4P20A0A> . Social media is compounding the challenge, with Facebook “a potent rival, touting its more precise data on users.” On the upside, Android ran 80% of smartphones sold in 2014 and Google hosts more search queries on mobile than it does on desktop. 

Golden Age Of Viewability 

Speaking to Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPlH4B00W000qAP0020AhD>  late last week, GroupM’s John Montgomery calls much of the clamor around viewability “apocryphal” and based on “self-interest.” He counters, “We’ve seen viewable ads increase by nearly 30% year on year,” Montgomery said. “Other agencies I speak to have seen the same thing. Web designers are redesigning their pages to make them much more viewable. Marketers are responding by paying premium rates for more viewable ads. So there’s a huge good news story to be told.” 

On Cross-Device Attribution 

In an interview with  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000P2Il0L0B0iA4PDAq> eMarketer, Tapad’s SVP of global strategy, Nick Jordan, says cross-device is the key to successful attribution. “Multichannel, cross-device attribution is still largely a talking point,” Jordan said, responding to the point that AOL and Google both bought attribution firms last year and Facebook is delving into cross-device capabilities with Atlas. “But with companies like Google, AOL and Facebook hopping on board, adoption should hasten at least a little bit.” The challenge, he noted, is that buying is siloed. “The folks at agencies who buy display and mobile still think about their attribution needs from a display and mobile context,” Jordan said. “The same goes for the search and social teams and the television and offline teams.” If buying is siloed, so too is attribution. 

Video Ad Cash 

Innovid raised $10 million, and new investor Cisco Investment joined the round. Innovid works with advertisers to create, target and measure video ad campaigns and has banked a total of $37.6 million to date. Speaking to TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PjB00000AP4Dq02lWJ0> , CEO Zvika Netter said television and digital video are converging, and the rollout of Google Fiber and Apple’s forthcoming web TV service will quicken that convergence. Innovid will use the cash injection to build out its product offering for brands and media agencies, and grow its cross-device personalized video capabilities.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

The Market Shift To Social 

With Facebook’s developer conference F8 in full swing, eMarketer  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4K0w0P00qD002LBW01Al> reports that the social platform and Twitter will take a 33% share of the US digital display market by 2017 (a projected total of $37.36 billion). The research firm predicts US display in 2015 will hit $27.05 billion, with Facebook’s US ad revenues projected at $6.82 billion and Twitter’s at $1.34 billion. “Both Facebook’s and Twitter’s gains in the digital display market are driven by mobile advertising,” reads the report. “For the first time in 2015, mobile will surpass desktop in display ad spending in the US, increasing from $9.65 billion in 2014 to $14.67 billion. Meanwhile, desktop display ad spend will decline in 2015, falling to $12.38 billion, from $12.56 billion last year.” 

Kellogg’s Vexed By Viewability 

Speaking at Advertising Week Europe in London, Kellogg’s associate media director Amaya Garbayo said viewability trumps fraud on the brand’s list of concerns. “Video is a lot more problematic than display when it comes to non-human traffic because there is more desirable inventory and the CPM is higher. There are tools on the marketplace to avoid some of that,” Garbayo said. “Non-human traffic may have been in the news lately and is very important but viewability is a lot larger for Kellogg’s.” The brand has recently prioritized programmatic through the creation of an in-house unit and a partnership with Yahoo’s video platform, BrightRoll. More via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/AK0x04WB200AlPq00L020DA> . 

Publicis’ Takeover Plan 

In the wake of its $3.7 billion Sapient takeover last November, Publicis boss Maurice Lévy spells out the holding company’s 2015 acquisition strategy. “We will spend much less than previous years and that's clearly because we have made this [Sapient] acquisition in cash and we have to reduce our debt level, which we will do,” Lévy  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000K23l0L0B0yA4PDAq> told Business Insider. “We are delivering close to $1 billion of free cash flow, which will help us a great deal. Acquisitions we will be doing will be limited to either some region of the world where we need to complete some of our network or in some specific capabilities in digital, or in analytics, or data.” Lévy was quick to throw Razorfish under the bus, claiming that without the impact of “difficulties” with Razorfish’s business, Publicis would have posted a 4% growth rate for 2014. 

APAC For The Win 

According to a forecasting report from Carat Global, digital ad spend in the Asia Pacific is poised to grow 20.1% this year, tops in the world. Carat further anticipates North America to spike by 16.4%. Latin America will also have similar growth at 16.2%. “Online Video has a 21.6% forecast for 2015, with growth partly driven by a shift of investment away from TV,” reports Marketing Interactive <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB004WqA000lPKA0z040D2L> . “Expectations are particularly high for original content. In the US, nearly half (48%) of online video budgets will go to ’made for digital’ video.” 

Targeted Audio Ads Play Ball 

Beginning with the 2015 Major League Baseball season, Triton Digital will exclusively deliver and monetize streaming audio ads for MLB.com Gameday Audio desktop and the MLB.com At Bat mobile app. The partnership marks Gameday Audio’s first foray into targeted audio ads. “Baseball fans are passionate, engaged, and devote a lot of time to listening to their favorite teams’ games,” said John Rosso, Triton Digital’s president of market development. “This partnership enables advertisers to deliver targeted and on-message ads to a highly qualified and sought-after, live audience.” Read the  <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0l05WD0L4PA0A2q0K0BA00> release.

New Sales Platform 

Following George John’s exit <http://go.adexchanger.com/qlAW0A0DLC004K02B0P700q>  as Rocket Fuel CEO, Lotame CEO Andy Monfried sheds some light on the shift from selling managed services to platforms. He argues that the business of selling platforms versus managed serves differs because the former requires “more nuanced positioning and go-to-market strategies.” He presents six core pillars to the sale of platforms, such as avoiding random data points and ensuring one has numerous referenceable clients. “It’s ok for a buyer to ask these questions and it’s a must for a seller to be able to articulate their position against them,” he writes <http://go.adexchanger.com/GlB0AK20DD48W0AL0000P0q> . “As an industry we certainly don’t need more acronyms, but what every company who is selling a platform does need is a hard and fast set of standards that represent their core values and mission.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Multichannel For The Win 

ESPN is trumpeting the importance of multichannel advertising in anticipation of this year’s upfronts, according to The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PaBKD000qA2F04L0l> . As evidence, the ESPN Lab collected 15- and 30-second spots from eight advertisers and exposed the ads to sample audiences on TV, over-the-top devices, desktop and mobile video clips. As a result, purchase intent increased 160% when audiences saw a combination of TV spots, short-form video ads and app ads. Awareness spiked 36% and word of mouth jumped 67%. The article claims this study underscores how TV faces competition for viewers hopping across numerous screens and content delivery channels. 

Publishers Partner 

Publishers assemble! Speaking at the Guardian’s Changing Media Summit on Wednesday, AppNexus president Michael Rubenstein called the newly formed publisher alliance Pangaea <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02L000bF00lPW04DABAqL0>  a clear response to the continued aggregation of market power. “Facebook and Google are continuing to amass market power and I think that is tremendously concerning to the independent publishing community,” he said. He anticipates more alliances between publishers that typically compete with each other, simply because “It’s difficult to function and compete effectively at a scaled level.” The Guardian has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/uM0000DB4L0A0c02FPqWAl0> . 

Programmatic Video Gets Emotional 

On Wednesday, programmatic video platform provider Unruly unveiled a targeting tool that lets advertisers identify and connect with consumers most likely to emotionally engage with a particular video ad. In essence, the capability lets advertisers leverage content testing results to inform video ad buys. “Consumers who are more emotionally engaged with a branded video are more likely to share the video, more likely to remember the brand, and more likely to buy the product,” said Unruly CEO Scott Button. “For marketers, this means more engagement, more earned media and, ultimately, more sales. … We’re helping advertisers to bridge the gap between the content stack and the tech stack.” Marketing Land has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000F2Nl0L0B0dA4PDAq> . 

Privacy, Please! 

A panel at the Programmatic Insider Summit in Arizona veered toward private vs, open marketplaces. Brian Nadres, director of programmatic media buying at The Media Kitchen, says buyers would be wise to inquire about private marketplaces if they notice a publisher repeatedly popping up on open exchanges. “Chances are that publisher’s waterfall isn’t flexible enough to handle an open exchange outbidding someone with a direct deal [or private marketplace deal],” Nadres said. Brian Brownie, director of ad operations at eBay, adds that private marketplaces could potentially give marketers greater visibility into programmatic’s proverbial “black box.” More via MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWF4lA00eL0PB0O2> . 

BuzzFeed Searches For ROI Proof 

BuzzFeed is on a mission to prove the value of its native content, Digiday reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/qlAW0A0DLf004F02B0PP00q> . Zemanta CEO Todd Sawicki attributes the current lack of quantifiable ROI to native advertising’s relative youth. “Most multi-point attribution modeling is done well after the fact and even then only really works when there are large, significant campaigns that will show up in the market research,” he said. “Right now, most native advertising is small and experimental and doesn’t yet rise to the level where it shows up in those models.” So, BuzzFeed is doubling its research staff in a targeted effort to demonstrate ROI on the millions of views and shares of its native ads.

Data Tug Of War 

RadioShack is auctioning off data on millions of its customers as part of the company’s bankruptcy proceedings, and regulators from Texas and Tennessee have been quick to protest. RadioShack’s privacy statement has long restricted the sale of consumer PII, expressly stating, “We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone at any time." AT&T objects to the sale as well, but on different grounds, claiming that the data belongs to them “through a mobile-phone selling arrangement.” The case brings to light two emerging issues for brick-and-mortar brands: the unset value of their customer data archives and the rights of those customers to decide who can access their PII.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Publisher Mothership 

Facebook has been in quiet communication with at least six media companies about hosting publishers’ content inside Facebook, rather than directing users to an external site, The New York Times reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/lzBq1000LlDP0A2A4000H0W> . Sources say Facebook will roll out the format in the next several months. But publishers must be willing to share content freely outside their walls, and that includes the consumer data that comes with it. “It’s a scary proposition because publishers want to control their brand, and their audience and their advertising dollars,” said newspaper consultant Alan Mutter. And Facebook only stands to gain, he added. “It enhances user satisfaction, keeps users on its site and has better content which allows it to sell advertising at better rates.” 

The Mobile Ad Spend Boom 

Mobile spend will make up 72% of total digital ad spend in the US by 2019, according to research from eMarketer <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40I0A2z0B2LD0WlP00q0A0> . The findings put US mobile ad spend on track to increase 50% this year and hit $28.7 billion. At that volume, mobile ad spend will account for 49% of all digital ad spending in the US. “The shift to mobile ad spending is being driven mainly by consumer demand,” eMarketer notes. “In 2014, US adults spent an average of 2 hours, 51 minutes with mobile devices each day, up from 2 hours, 19 minutes in 2013. Meanwhile, desktop time fell to 2 hours, 12 minutes daily last year, after being equal with mobile time in 2013.” 

Creating More ‘Content You May Like’ 

Taboola is giving publishers a free add-on that allows them to optimize their content, dubbed Taboola Newsroom. “It’s Google Analytics of 2015 for content creators,” CEO Adam Singolda told AdExchanger, comparing the tools to the internal ones used by sites like Mashable or Vice. Taboola Newsroom helps publishers A/B test headlines and images and find out what content works best on mobile vs. desktop. It also provides input into how to make content perform on social networks. When using the tool, Refinery29 reported a 45% increase in the click-through rate on its home page. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02J0003z00lPW04DABAqL0> . 

For Big Data, It’s ‘A Rose By Any Name’ 

Marketers are expected to spend $11.5 billion on data-related services in 2015, up almost 10% from 2010’s $10.5 billion total, according to research from Winterberry Consultants. Ad Age’s Kate Kaye explores what that means for some of the largest data research and analytics firms, who have been caught up in a flurry of acquisitions and brand pivots in an attempt to – as Kaye puts it – put on “the slick clothes and cool tattoos of the modern marketing industry.” More than anything, these changes point toward the hesitancy of data services to adopt clear-cut labels in an environment where agencies, media networks, vendors and consultancies are converging into...what?

From Text To Commerce 

Analysis from Flurry Insights suggests that messaging apps may be muscling in on traditional banking – and the’ve got the millennial market cornered, compounded by customer loyalty. Retention rates for messaging apps far exceed the average app retention rate, according to Flurry’s findings, and are used on average nearly nine times a day. “It is safe to say that messaging apps have made the leap to become the platform for many services, starting with payments and most likely ending with commerce,” reads the  <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02L0005z00lPW04DABAqL0> report. And with rumors swirling about Facebook turning its messenger into a platform, advertisers and bankers may be next to join the conversation. Elsewhere, Seeking Alpha posits <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0lqW0D006AMB0z4PA>  on the future of FB messenger.

Illusive TV Addressability 

Speaking to Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0P8BOD000qA2z04L0l> , Rob Norman, chief digital officer at GroupM, throws cold water on the relative value of programmatic buying for TV vs. the potential for addressable TV. Norman doesn’t think TV advertising is ripe for a programmatic upgrade. “The TV market is a much more sophisticated market than people give it credit for, and I think that digital natives who don’t have the contexts for pre-digital have a somewhat naive view of the integrity and intricacy of the television market,” Norman said. In terms of addressable TV, he added, “the technology doesn’t exist in any way that is scaled.” Connected TV and IP-enabled devices are another story.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

The Fee Abides

The “kickback” debate continues to burn as agencies and marketers butt heads over transparency on fees and services. Ad Age’s Alexandra Bruell finds that so-called kickbacks – or rebates – make sense to some considering the plight of the agency model. She writes, “One marketer who oversees his agency relationship said fees have come down to below 4% from 15% over the years. They were once much higher because media duties were bundled in with creative and production duties, and those businesses are more labor-intensive.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/TC0Wp0P0l000DBs20L4qAA0> .

FTC Doubles Down On Data

The Federal Trade Commission has set up a division under its Bureau of Consumer Protection that will focus on, among other things, the privacy implications of connected devices. In a recruiting blog post, the agency’s chief technologist defined the new Office of Technology Research and Investigation (OTRI) <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ap0D04WB200AlPq00L0t0DA> ’s scope as “privacy, data security, connected cars, smart homes, algorithmic transparency, emerging payment methods, big data, and the Internet of Things.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00pA0L0Du00lB2qW0AEP04> 

Activatin’ CRM Audiences

Salesforce.com marked the wide release of Active Audiences <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PFDpA40LlB00vA> , a tool it has developed in beta since 2013. Active Audiences forges a tighter integration between some of Salesforce.com’s acquired parts – including social ad-buying platform Social.com and ExactTarget. Active Audiences lets marketers tap in to CRM data in real time and segment audiences for targeting on Facebook, Twitter and mobile apps via the Facebook Audience Network (FAN). Salesforce.com’s definition of “paid media” thus far has been social advertising via partner platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter and LinkedIn. Salesforce.com is also connecting CRM data back to email and site-based messaging through ExactTarget. Are Google and virtually every other ad network on its bucket list? Time will tell. The blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqGB0l2LW004D0P0AAw0p00> .

Avalanche’s Je Ne Sais Quoi

Digital advertising’s hottest new format is an offering from Avalanche, according to the WSJ’s Mike Shields and Jack Marshall. The format was conceived by Velocity Made Good founder Chris Batty, who in a previous life worked in digital sales for Gawker Media and CNET. Avalanche has run 230 campaigns, and it worked with 30 publishers last year, including Vice. “[The Avalanche] delineates between editorial and ads, but puts them in a package that is less jarring,” commented VP Andrew Creighton. “That is important for sites with limited real estate.” The format is a notable development, as the industry struggles with the delineation of sponsored content.

SpotXchange’s Programmatic Forecast

Speaking to Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ap0I04WB200AlPq00L0y0DA> , SpotXchange CEO Mike Shehan predicts that SSPs and ad servers will go extinct in the next two years. According Shehan, the two are combining into one service, which he calls an “inventory management platform.” “When you think programmatic, a lot of people have a Pavlovian response and say, ‘That’s a race to the bottom,’” he said. “That’s totally inaccurate. … If you really harness this power of programmatic for the supply side, [publishers] can sell [their] inventory for a lot higher CPMs. But it takes a new way of executing and you can’t use your traditional ad servers.”

Gartner: Semantics Matter

Ad tech vendors and industry players are using the term “personalization” in misleading ways, writes Gartner veteran analyst Andrew Frank in a blog post. According to Frank, “personalization” practices are limiting marketers’ ability to de-identify consumers in order to adhere to privacy regulations. To cut through the confusion, Garter proposes the industry adopt “personification” in place of “personalization.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/iKpW00BlPAL00A000Dq2A04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Eat Your Fiber 

Google’s broadband “Fiber” initiative and its TV ad measurement businesses will dovetail nicely, at least as part of a Kansas City pilot, Adweek reports. “Every household with Google Fiber, obviously, has a Google Fiber box. And that box can put the ad in whenever it's timely, and tell the client about it.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00l06k0WbDP0L0A00>  

Video Ad Revenue Potential 

Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente says Facebook is poised to attract a significant chunk of TV ad budgets in the next two years, and could generate as much as $3.8 billion in video ad revenue by 2017. Variety reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0cL0000kP02BAqDl0740A>  that volume is triple what analysts have estimated the social giant will reel in this year. “Facebook and YouTube will likely be the largest players in online video, providing differentiated offerings with respect to pricing, targeting and engagement,” according to DiClemente. And YouTube could solve Facebook’s sticky hearability issue with in-feed video ads. “YouTube audiences are more likely to be watching ads with sound, again due to users’ intention of watching video content,” noted DiClemente. 

NYT’s Mobile Monetization Battle 

The New York Times is shifting resources from every division to mobile as the company struggles to nail down a mobile monetization plan, according to NYT Now editorial chief Clifford Levy. NYT Now is the publisher’s stab at a low-cost, subscription-based app that’s skewed to a slightly younger demographic. “Every division in the company is looking at how they can shift more resources to mobile,” Levy told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPl84B00W000qAk0020AdD> . But for NYT Now, “The business model was not as successful as we hoped. That's one reason why … we're considering other options including whether or not to move toward a free model.” More than 50% of the NYT’s traffic comes from mobile, but the channel only accounts for 10% of the publisher’s digital ad revenue. 

How ’Bout That MoPub? 

Speaking of mobile monetization, Twitter-owned MoPub released some bright video ad stats <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PeB00000Ak4Dq02lW90> . Video advertising on the MoPub platform grew 224% last year. Publishers also increased their video inventory sixfold during that time. On the MoPub platform, video ads are outperforming full-screen interstitials and earned eCPMs 29.5% higher than non-video interstitial during Q4 2014. MoPub is also experimenting with new ways to monetize, one of which lets publishers reward users for watching video ads. The data release comes as Facebook reportedly prepares to release its own mobile exchange platform. 

Yahoo Touts Tumblr 

Speaking to The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqfB0l2LW004D0P0AAa0k00> , Yahoo’s head of international marketing, Robert Bridge, shed some light on the company’s search and mobile roadmap post Flurry and BrightRoll acquisitions. But the sleeper strategy for Yahoo could be social. “Tumblr continues to grow incredibly organically and is at 440 million monthly users per month. The engagement rate on Tumblr is higher than any social network – it’s 16 minutes per session – which is more than Facebook,” Bridge said. “If you look at Facebook sharing posts in-feed means it has a much more limited shelf life – it disappears as soon as it has gone into the feed. Tumblr is more likely to be seen – 30% of the ads are likely to be seen 30 days after posted. It also bubbles up onto Yahoo.”

Rebate Strike 

The Marketing Agency Association (MAA), a UK-based trade body, is rising up against Anheuser-Busch InBev. According to the MAA, AB InBev asked agencies to spell out their rebate plans in recent work pitches. In response, the MAA has called on those UK agencies to begin a strike on April 7. “The MAA takes bad pitch practice and exploitative payment terms extremely seriously,” the group’s managing director, Scott Knox, said in a statement. “AB InBev is behaving disgracefully, forcing agencies to provide them with discounts and financial sweeteners across every possible work stream.” Bloomberg has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWc400h0ABD00k0lL02P0Aq> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Is This Town Big Enough For Two? 

The face-off between Israeli-bred competitors Outbrain and Taboola is punishing margins, leading some to wonder if the firms should hurry up and merge already. But the contenders don’t see it that way, and analysts agree. “Competition is ruthless, and everything between Outbrain and Taboola is aggressive,” Eric Yohay, an ad tech industry consultant, told the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000C2040qAlLPDBeD0WA0> . Content rec firms pay publishers more for page views today than they did three years ago, with CPMs up from $0.75 to between $2.50 and $3.50. Meanwhile, advertisers’ fees have remained the same. Taboola raised a $117 million in February on the heels of Outbrain’s $100 million round in November. 

Local Programmatic TV 

Indie media agency Empower partnered with ad tech firm Savveo to execute local programmatic broadcast media campaigns with Scripps-owned TV stations. The ads will run in the second quarter. “A lot of the local television stations are scared of this, because they worry for their sales reps,” Empower CEO Jim Price told AdExchanger. “But what stations have to understand is that agencies are expecting to transact in this way, and they need to build the technology that gives us a real-time look into their inventory that allows us to be more dynamic about how we plan and buy it.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4e0D0P00qD002LBW0EAl> . 

Digital Audio And iAd 

Digital audio is shifting to mobile, eMarketer reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0Fe0Ll0DB0E0W0q4P20A0A> , with music listening on smartphones in the US set to grow an estimated 15% this year. At that rate, audiences will total nearly 100 million and account for 52.3% of all US smartphone users. Meanwhile, 55% of US listeners age 12 and up use a mobile device, tablet or portable audio device for podcast listening, according to Edison Research and Triton Digital <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bl00FW2A000040eB0DGLPqA> . “Frequent podcast listening suggests marketers could leverage the medium to reach a fairly engaged audience,” eMarketer reports. “For now, though, usage is low.” As if on cue, Apple is making its iTunes radio inventory available programmatically through iAd. More on that via Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02H000Ge00lPW04DABAqL0> . 

Sorrell’s Blurred Lines 

Speaking to Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PlH00q2I0e> , and interviewed by WPP Digital President David Moore, WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrell says consolidation is impacting how WPP views the competition. “You see what Salesforce is trying to do, what Adobe is trying to do, what Oracle with [its acquisition of] Datalogix is trying to do. This is all a blurring of the lines.” 

Mohan On Viewability 

In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0JelWPI0A00> , Google display and video ad chief Neal Mohan calls on the industry to continue to focus on counting viewable impressions, not percentages. He admits this is a tall order, and one his company has not solved…yet. “Marketers are not saying that they want a percentage of their campaign to be seen; rather, they are saying they want to pay only for viewable impressions,” he writes. “I understand this is a significant challenge, one we're working to solve on our own media properties; without a solution, however, viewable impressions cannot become a currency for the industry.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Tech: It’s Everywhere Visa Wants To Be 

Speaking to Ad Age, Visa CMO Antonio Lucio said the company fancies itself a tech firm, and it plans to back that fact by hiring 500 engineers in Austin, Texas, this year. Visa spends 46% of its ad budget on digital media, but Lucio estimates that figure will surpass 50% by the end of the year. “Most people don’t see Visa as a technology company,” Lucio told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DlBqA0020P0WfA8800> . “Our vision is to make sure more developers can use Visa to generate the next generation of mobile payments.” In fact, Visa will put a portion of its digital spend towards a spot in next year’s Super Bowl to showcase its idea of “frictionless payment” in Levi’s Stadium. 

Lego Brand, Media Corp. 

As Visa turns to tech, the brand infamous for wrecking parents’ feet is turning to content. Wait, what? “We used to be a toy manufacturer. Now we're turning more and more into a media company to tell our story about these bricks. We need a lot of content to tell that story,” said Lego VP of Marketing Conny Kalcher, speaking at the Global Marketer Conference in Marrakech. Lego’s shift from paid to owned media is a data-driven endeavor, with new real-time media centers informing content and campaign creation. “For us it's just as important to stimulate the conversation between one consumer and another rather than just leading the conversation,” he added. The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0l008q9g> . 

Efficiency, You’re A Jewel 

Nuanced targeting and data mining drives audience engagement, but it did more than that for jewelry company Ritani. Last year, AOL began buying TV ads for Ritani on about a dozen national cable networks through Adapt.tv. The campaign coupled Ritani’s proprietary data with data from AOL and third-party providers like Axciom, boosting sales. “The whole point of this is, there is way too much waste on TV,” said Mark Keeney, Ritani’s VP of marketing “We’re a startup. We have to be focused on efficiency. And this allows for precision.” More via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0h80Ll0DB0a0W0q4P20A0A> . 

Dazed By Data 

Brands are struggling to apply their data to improve consumer experiences, according to research from Econsultancy and tag management firm Ensighten. While 96% of brands recognize the importance of the consumer experience, 62% are overwhelmed by the volume of data they’re managing and 85% say they can’t derive the full value of the data they obtain. “Marketing organizations continue to struggle with large data and technology silos, as well as with shortage of talent to overcome them," commented Boaz Ronkin, Ensighten’s SVP of product. "To maximize the return on investment in their marketing technology stacks, CMOs must look for integrated solutions that excel at joining disparate systems, rather than add new standalone systems into the mix." BizReport has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0bL00008P02BAqDl0i40A> . 

Programmatic Hookup 

Following Telstra subsidiary Ooyala’s acquisition <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0l0jWD0L4Pc0A2q080BA00>  of European video SSP Videoplaza last fall, the company is priming for a US push. As part of that effort, Videoplaza CEO Sorosh Tavakoli was named SVP of ad tech for Ooyala and will relocate to NYC. And the company has forged a premium programmatic marketplace with video demand-side platform TubeMogul. “We’re entering a world where everyone’s frenemies,” Tavakoli told AdExchanger, adding that platforms like Facebook and Google, and cable companies like Comcast, are all competing to serve premium publishers in some capacity. “We’re coming at this as an enterprise, ad-serving and SSP technology platform built for premium publishers.” Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/qlAW0A0DLd004802B0Pk00q> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Is iAd Apple’s Sleeping Giant?

With headlines percolating about Apple's plans for a subscription TV streaming service, Business Insider’s global advertising editor, Lara O'Reilly, says the offering could revive Apple’s dormant ad business, iAd. “[iAd] may just make up an estimated 0.3% of Apple's total revenue now, but it could become a far bigger division were it to be paired with Apple TV. And that could become a pain point when it comes to Apple abiding by its core values,” O’Reilly writes. “Nevertheless, Apple TV shows what could be possible: Linking the targeted, measurable world of online with the reach and scale of television. For advertisers, that's a very exciting prospect indeed.” But first, Apple will need to spur adoption in an increasingly crowded OTT environment. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PZB00000A44Dq02lWa0>  and see AdExchanger’s most recent iAd coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/A40004WB200AlPq00L0b0DA> .

Automated VOD

British public broadcaster Channel 4 is starting programmatic VOD sales through a partnership with Dentsu Aegis. Denstu media agencies Carat and Vizeum will buy targeted on-demand TV inventory from the publishers, which will run on Samsung TV, YouView and Xbox later this year. For now, direct deals are the only option. “At the moment we are not offering agencies the ability to buy in real time, though that is something we are investigating,” Channel 4’s head of digital innovation, Jonathan Lewis, told The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0c40Ll0DB010W0q4P20A0A> . “It’s very technically complex to deliver RTB on a programmatic basis but it’s something we’re looking at. … We’re giving access to our first-party data, in a way which we have never done before – agencies and DSPs can access our data and use it alongside their own buy-side data.”

Bitly Runs Deep

Bitly is going beyond short links to deep links. There are quite a lot of deep-linking technologies already on the market, but Bitly’s new deep-linking feature is targeted at marketers rather than developers – a key differentiator, according to Bitly’s new chief product officer, Matt Thomson. “Deep links from Bitly puts marketers in control,” Thomson told AdExchanger. “It’s enabling them to drive users to specific in-app locations, invite them to download an app or open content in a desktop browser, depending on the user and the device – all with nothing more than an app ID.” More from MarketingLand <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0lAA20Dd400> .

Cardlytics Check-In

Mobile Payment startup Cardlytics is on a mission to change the way banks, businesses and consumers interact, and to help advertisers ride that wave. “We have true partnerships with more than four hundred banks, access to consumer transaction streams and spend data for up to about seventy percent,” Cardlytics CMO Kasey Byrne told Payment Week. “And that means seventy percent of US households, which means that we can see transactions, past purchase histories, of millions and millions of consumers. We use that to help retailers and restaurants reach those consumers through their online mobile banking channels.” Back in October, Cardlytics President and COO Lynne Laube told  <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00eWqA000lP4A03040D2L> AdExchanger the firm wanted to take advantage of a potential IPO within 12 to 18 months.

Oracle’s Marketing Cloud Update

During a combative Q3 earnings call, in which Oracle fired shots at cloud competitors like Salesforce and ERP competitors like SAP, CEO Mark Hurd provided a brief, laudatory update on the company’s Marketing Cloud. He said the acquisitions of Responsys and Eloqua made Oracle “leaders” in B2C and B2B marketing, respectively. He also said the acquisitions of data companies BlueKai and Datalogix “differentiate us not just in the marketing automation process, but also in the underpinning datasets CMOs get access to.” As a result, Hurd said, Oracle’s marketing software grew more than 200% quarter over quarter. “When you look at our competitors, whether Adobe or Salesforce.com, you see we’re simply growing faster and taking market share in market SaaS,” Hurd claimed.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Publicis Undesked 

The decentralization of Publicis Group’s programmatic buying activities away from its VivaKi trading desk hub to embed within operating agencies is a natural progression, SMG’s programmatic SVP, Mac Delaney, tells Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40y0A2U0BcLD0WkP00q0A0> . “The operators ... within AOD [will be] there to help inform what an audience strategist should be, before an RFP is even created. In a very good way, it’s going to disrupt the way the staffing and resourcing, the skill sets of those resources, have been aligned to agencies’ account teams.” Watch it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40y0A2U0BcLD0WkP00q0A0>  

Acquisition, Mon Amour 

Chinese software company Cheetah Mobile shelled out $58 million to buy French mobile ad tech player MobPartner. The deal will help Cheetah, known for its anti-virus solution and battery saver app, get a slice of mobile ad revenue. Founded in 2009, MobPartner’s tech revolves around driving traffic and installs. “We have very complementary footprints: Cheetah Mobile has built an extraordinarily large and engaged audience on mission-critical mobile apps around the world, and we have built a solid global mobile monetization engine,” MobPartner CEO Djamel Agaoua told AdExchanger. More in VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pz40U0DdAkq2> . MobPartner isn’t the only French ad tech player to get snapped up in recent weeks. MakeMeReach, SocialMoov and Appsfire were all acquired in February. (AdExchanger coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0keA0000q0DA20LAWU> .) 

Forbes, Adorbs 

Forbes Media acquired the photo sharing mobile app Camerama, calling it a strategic acquisition that will enable it to build online communities and its mobile presence. What types of communities might Forbes build? “We’re focused on the under-30, investing and other professional audiences,” Chief Product Officer Lewis D’Vorkin told AdExchanger, adding Forbes will “[use] the underlying technology” of Camerama. The founder of the company, Salah Akram Zalatimo, will join Forbes as VP of mobile products. Zalatimo is the only member of the team joining Forbes.

In-House Down Under 

The shift to bring programmatic in-house is just as prevalent in Australia as it is in the US, Google group product manager Payam Shodjai told The Australian, and that’s hitting media agencies hard. According to The Australian, the trend is doubly bad for media agencies as cloud software firms release more programmatic ad-buying products. “Already, large advertisers William Hill and Lenovo are using parts of Adobe’s Marketing Cloud platform in Australia in their programmatic trading operations, which can bid for large, highly targeted audiences online and match ads to them at the click of a button,” writes online media editor Lara Sinclair.

3Q Digital Exits 

Marketing firm Harte Hanks bought independent digital marketing shop 3Q Digital for an undisclosed sum. Prior to the exit, the 120-strong shop worked with clients like Symantec, SurveyMonkey, Wine.com and California Closets. 3Q Digital chief David Rodnitzky said in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0DU0Lk0DB0h0W0q4P20A0A> . “We look forward to expanding [our] expertise as a part of Harte Hanks and bridging the interactions that occur from traditional marketing to digital marketing.” Read an AdExchanger interview with Rodnitzky <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4U0i0P00qD002LBW0EAk>  from March 2014, at which time the firm was managing roughly $300 million in spend.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Powering The Transaction 

Facebook has acquired, and shut down, personalized commerce search app TheFind. TheFind combines search data with longitudinal purchase data to refine product suggestions. Facebook needs smarter targeting for retail marketers. Could this be the bridge? TechCruch has more. <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0WL0000QP02BAqDk0m40A>  “Facebook's resources and platform give us the opportunity to scale our expertise in product sourcing to the over 1 billion people that use the platform,” TheFind said in a statement on its site <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0QA0DB0Wn2Lq00kA00X4P0> . 

Havas Joins Viewability Hard Liners 

Havas Chief Media Officer Adam Kasper is the latest agency heavy talking up a 100%-viewable standard. Speaking to Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/ykQWDqP00A0LABo04Y00020> , Kasper called current standards “Kind of a joke,” adding that “[i]t doesn’t really offer us anything. Fifty percent for one second? What does that do for you? It needs to be 100 percent, and it needs to be longer than one second. I very much want to see it this year.” To boost viewability, Havas has teamed up with engagement-based ad network TrueX and has been testing the TrueX platform with some of its clients. The tech is now available to all Havas customers. “We’re not moving all our media buying to TrueX but we expect to scale this pretty rapidly,” said Kasper. 

Ad Blocking Woes 

Ad-blocking software is on the rise and pre-roll video ads are fueling the growth, according to a Wells Fargo Securities report released Friday. The report ranks ad blocking as a challenge on par with viewability. "Our work leads us to conclude that the power that Google and Apple are able to exert over their respective ad ecosystems (through limitation of access to their app stores) affords them the ability to limit the adoption of third-party apps designed to block ads,” reads the report. According to the findings, publishers are hit the hardest by ad-blocking practices. Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0k00QqZp> . 

Yesterday’s Programmatic 

Speaking to The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000Q2qk0L0B00A4PDAq> , Chris Dobson, executive chairman of The Exchange Lab, says “remnant” is now definitively part of the past. “We have moved past the preconceptions that programmatic trading offloads ‘remnant, cheap’ inventory,” Dobson said. “In 2014, we saw many large brands go public with their programmatic strategies, including luxury brand Burberry. This move helps to dispel the myths surrounding programmatic and instils confidence in other marketers to explore the innovation and benefits that it offers.” 

Programmatic Diagnosis 

RTB will account for 33% of digital ad sales in the US by 2018, jumping to $18.2 billion from 2013’s $3.1 billion, says BI Intelligence. Mobile and video ads will spur this growth, with spend in those categories hitting $6.8 billion and $3.9 billion in 2018, respectively. The report counts Criteo, Rocket Fuel, Rubicon and AOL among the top programmatic players in the US, together grossing more than $1.5 billion in global ad revenue in 2013. The study also explores barriers to programmatic adoption, changes in pricing and evaluates other key players in the programmatic space.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Nestlé Speaks 

On stage at the IAB’s conference in London, Gawain Owen, digital lead at Nestlé, offered brands some advice. “Ask your agency for log-ins,” he said. “I can log-in at any time and see how my campaigns are performing because [the agencies] have nothing to hide.” Logins give brands unfettered access to the platforms they’re licensing, he explained, which increases transparency and boosts demand for programmatic buying. Next, Owen touched on Nestlé’s programmatic video focus. “We are a television-led business, that’s why it’s so important for us” he said. “For me, premium, guaranteed, whatever you want to call it in the video sector, [it] is an absolute must.” More via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/ykLWDqP00A0LABC04700020> . 

Google-InMobi Chatter 

On the heels of its rumored acquisition by Google – first reported by the Economic Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0LA0DB0WD2Lq00kA0084P0>  – InMobi employees received an email from chief Naveen Tewari dismissing the chatter. “Given the level of innovation and disruption we are about to cause, there is no reason to sell," Tewari wrote. But sources tell Business Insider that Google is still dreaming of a mobile land grab. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00k0EL0W9DP0L0A00> . 

Snapchat Market Cap Climbs 

Sources tell The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DkBqA0020P0WFALa00>  that Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba is investing $200 million in Snapchat, which would bring the ephemeral messaging app’s value to $15 billion. The investment would follow Alibaba’s string of investments in US startups, including video call app TangoMe, car service Lyft and mobile search provider Quixey. Alibaba first considered investing in Snapchat in July, following the Yahoo round that brought Snapchat to a $10 billion market cap, but those plans never came to fruition. Back in January, SunTrust published 10 reasons why Alibaba should buy the app <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00k0GL0WbDP0L0A00> . Just saying. 

Streaming’s On Fire 

Data from Nielsen suggests that two in five US households now subscribe to video streaming providers like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu. Meanwhile, according the the data, live television watching is way down and total time spent on web and mobile is up. On average, adults in the US spent an hour and 25 minutes per day using a smartphone during 2014’s third quarter, up 18 minutes YoY. Nielsen SVP of insights Dounia Turrill says companies need to capitalize on digital if they mean to stay afloat. “With continued and accelerating fragmentation, the risks and rewards are potentially high,” she said. “The ability to stake a claim in the expanding industry pie is central to companies’ growth.” More via The New York Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pkc00q2H0L> . 

Publicis Invests In Commerce 

Publicis snapped up “commerce agency” Expicient for an undisclosed sum. The buy comes weeks after Publicis finalized its Sapient takeover, which established the Publicis.Sapient network that now houses a number of digital agencies, including Rosetta and Razorfish. “Communications and commerce aren't separate ideas," said Publicis.Sapient CEO Alan Herrick. "The ability to optimize commerce infrastructure fits into how you think about mobile pay, in-aisle shopping and mobile experience that complements that. If the client says, 'I need you to help me optimize the omni-channel environment,' [that could span] investments in online media, direct marketing and optimization of inventory." Expicient has worked with brands like Argos, Bed Bath & Beyond, J. Crew and Target. Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqdP04A0LB0WAL02k0000ID> .

Programmatic-First Publishers 

Speaking to Beet.TV, SpotXchange SVP Sean Buckley said a programmatic-first mentality is ever more prevalent among publishers and broadcasters. “The traditional model is ‘let’s sell everything we can up-front through a direct sales model and then whatever’s left let’s push in to our SSP platform or exchange environments,’” he said. “Now, we’re hearing the strategy [of] putting programmatic first from major broadcasters and premium publishers. As recently as three years ago, it was an afterthought, if it was even a thought at all.” For the record, SpotXchange offers a programmatic video platform for publishers.

Merkle Surges 

CRM agency Merkle posted 20% growth in revenue year over year for 2014 to $382 million and projects $1 billion in managed client spend in 2015, up from $600 million in 2014. Propelling its growth in part were partnerships with Twitter for its Tailored Audiences product, as well as an early agency deal with Facebook’s new ad server, Atlas. Merkle’s roots as a CRM agency have positioned it well to connect media to the database record. Merkle was acquisitive in 2014, adding agencies RKG and New Control, as well as loyalty platform 500friends, into its strategic fold.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

No PubMatic IPO 

Plenty can change in a year, which is how long it’s been since PubMatic started dreaming about a $1 billion  <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWP400f0ABD00G0kL02P0Aq> IPO. Today? "There is no plan for IPO,” CEO Rajeev Goel tells Indian newspaper Business Standard. “We would like to remain as a private limited entity. Our focus is only on execution. Also, we are not looking for any round of funding in future. We are self funded now and will expand on our own capacities." Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWQ400g0ABD00G0kL02P0Aq>  Goel sounded a similar note in a recent AdExchanger interview, saying companies are taking more time to get profitable. “It’s forcing entrepreneurs like myself to focus on building a long-term profitable, viable business, and that’s a healthy thing." Related: Rocket Fuel has started a profitability push too <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBh000AGk0A200WL4qPR00> . 

Google Eyes InMobi 

Google is in talks to buy mobile ad network InMobi, The Economic Times reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PiBSD000qA2G04L0k> . In recent negotiations with investors, the India-based startup had discussed an asking price of more than $2 billion. Sources say the impetus is to compete with Facebook’s bullish mobile ad push. “Things were different last year, both for Google and InMobi,” said one anonymous source. “While Google was not facing the amount of heat it's witnessing today from Facebook on mobile, InMobi too was confident of raising another funding comfortably.” The mobile startup has both wide reach and a strong client base, and has been “innovating new ways to serve ads on mobile, and that technology would be of interest to Google,” Ovum senior analyst Neha Dharia tells The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000G2Tk0L0B0jA4PDAq> .

In an interview with The Drift <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0UkA00kGD0AP00040> , IPG Mediabrands’ SVP of ad operations, Mitch Weinstein, takes a stance on viewability. “If a publisher can guarantee that 70% of the impressions we’re buying are viewable, why can’t they simply guarantee that all of my impressions will be viewable?” Weinstein asks. “They can sell us fewer impressions – that’s ok. But what they sell us has to be viewable. Publishers will have to recalibrate how they sell, and start including only what they know they can deliver as viewable on each IO. This shouldn’t be a problem if the publisher has been doing their due diligence and testing with different viewability vendors on all of their inventory.” Beyond pushing for greater viewability, Weinstein says the focus at IPG is on dynamic ad serving using external triggers (think: weather). 

Jimmy Fallon Has Nice CPMs. Pass It On 

WIth users flocking to Jimmy Fallon’s NBC YouTube channel, The WSJ’s Mike Shields taps Open Slate to guess how much Jimmy & Co. are making with their online ad endeavors. Writes Shields, “Mr. Fallon’s channel could theoretically be sold as part of Google Preferred, YouTube’s premium sales offering, and could command a cost-per-thousand rate in the neighborhood of $25.” Read the final tally (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0VG0Lk0DB0l0W0q4P20A0A> . 

Snapsports 

Snapchat is forging partnerships with the NCAA and Turner Broadcasting, Digiday reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DkBqA0020P0WWAGm00> , in order to roll sports content into its “Our Story” feature. Sources tell Digiday that Snapchat plans to sell branded sponsorships against these stories under a rev-share agreement with content owners. “It’s a brilliant move,” said Rohit Thawani, director of digital strategy and social media at TBWA\Chiat\Day. “Snapchat is turning into the SportsCenter of cultural moments.” Come again?

Measuring The Content 

An Altimeter Group report finds measurement of content marketing is a huge pain point, and 67% of marketers are making it their big focus this year. According to the report, a broader range of metrics, like sentiment, content performance, share of voice and influencers, can help. “It is not uncommon to require a mixture of web analytics, content measurement, marketing technology and social media tools to assess the impact of content,” concludes the report, authored by Rebecca Lieb and Susan Etlinger. “As a result, content strategists should work with their analysts to develop a realistic (near term) and aspirational (longer term) measurement strategy.” Get it <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0YGkWPo0A00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Twitter’s Live Video Bet 

Twitter dropped a little less than $100 million for Periscope, a startup that’s been developing a live-video streaming app, according to The Wall Street Journal. The deal was first reported by Business Insider and was quietly finalized a month ago. The purported price tag would make this one of Twitter’s most expensive acquisitions. The buy bolsters Twitter’s video offering. Commented Ben Rubin, founder of Periscope live-streaming competitor Meerkat, “I think Twitter is a smart company and they know what they’re doing.

Unlike Twitter, Facebook has always posed a “social listening” challenge, since a large chunk of activity is locked up in password-protected news feeds. A new offering called Topic Data will alleviate that challenge by letting marketers link conversations surrounding events, brands and activities back to their businesses. Powered by DataSift, also a Twitter partner, the data is only available in aggregate and advertisers can’t use it to target ads. “While this type of data has been available from third parties before, the sample size was often too small to be significant and determining demographics was nearly impossible,” Facebook explained in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40q0A2B0BLLD0WkP00q0A0> . “With topic data, we’ve grouped data and stripped personal information from Facebook activity (not including Messenger) to offer insights on all the activity around a topic.” 

Content Is King. Agencies, Queens 

Speaking to Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000M2040qAkLPDBBr0WA0> , Peter Minnium, IAB’s head of digital brand initiatives, predicts that native advertising, or what he calls content advertising, will win more budget. But there will be casualties on the publisher side. “We will absolutely begin to see a shakeout over the next year to 18 months as traditional agencies begin to learn [native advertising] skills and bring them in house,” he said. “We're seeing interesting models now: Grey, DigitasLBi and Starcom MediaVest have groups. I think we're going to see a shakeout as publishers who are rushing into this space begin to realize how hard creative services is. Brand agencies have years of understanding how to optimize the process. As we move forward, brands are going to be more selective.” 

Adobe-Accenture Alliance 

Adobe has expanded partnership with Accenture with the launch of a managed service tool called Accenture Customer Engagement. Debuted at its annual Digital Marketing conference in Salt Lake City, the offering aims to simplify digital marketing development, deployment and measurement. The firms are betting on a need for speed – marketing deployment speed, that is – in light of a recent Accenture survey that suggests 43% of CMOs think their organization’s tech is too slow.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

YouTube Challengers 

Facebook, Snapchat, Vessel and others are in talks with TV broadcasters to offer better terms for video programming than YouTube, sources tell The Wall Street Journal. YouTube competitors are courting suppliers like Viacom, Time Warner, NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox. YouTube’s terms give 55% of ad revenue to content creators, but Facebook has offered at least one media giant 65%, say people familiar with the discussions. “Sharing of ad revenue is only one aspect of such deals,” write the Journal’s Shalini Ramachandran and Mike Shields. “Getting a better split with Facebook would mean little to media companies unless they could also guarantee their programming’s ad inventory is sold at a premium price. Discussions with Facebook are still at an early stage, and it isn’t clear whether media companies will get what they want.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0k00uqXJ> . 

Lacking The Ask 

In an interview with Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/FkDBL00KY0W0P2uq000AA04> , Havas Global CEO Andrew Benett says traditional TV budgets are slowly catching up to consumer viewing across screens. But marketers need to experiment more with targeting on the first screen, he adds. “I don't think there have been any breakthroughs, and no one has cracked the code yet because there hasn't been the ask,” Benett said. “You're seeing different messages targeting different groups in any one campaign, but it's not bought at the household level. It hasn't happened in the first-screen market because it's not in best interest of any of the cable operators or even the networks.” 

Video Viewability Evolution 

“We see [viewability] as a means to an end,” MRC SVP David Gunzareth tells Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DLA02000BWu0q4kZLP0A> . “We also see it as a stepping stone to another desirable end and that’s really to move the industry toward an audience-based currency based on GRPs. A prerequisite to having ad impressions that could be input into a GRP is that it has to be viewable. … For digital to operate on the same playing field as media like TV, it needs to be viewable.” In 2015, the MRC will push the industry to pivot to a GRP standard, he added. 

WPP Reports Solid Year 

WPP posted a 9.9% boost in year-end revenue, which totaled $19 billion in 2014. Organic revenue growth hit 8.2%, a noticeable jump on competing holding companies (such as Interpublic’s 5.5%, Omnicom’s 5.7% and Publicis’ meager 2%). What’s more, advertising and media investment management was WPP’s strongest-performing sector in 2014. “All in all, 2015 looks to be another demanding year, although a weaker UK pound against a stronger US dollar would provide a modest currency tailwind and positive impact on profits, unlike the fierce currency headwind in 2014,” WPP said in its release (PDF) <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW00L0000uP02BAqDk0M40A> . 

Advisory Alliance 

Two new-wave tech advisory and research firms have teamed up in the name of digital disruption at the research level.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Exchange Part Deux 

Facebook may be getting into the ad exchange business beyond its huge and popular Facebook Exchange (FBX <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00CWqA000kPqA0M040D2L> ), which functions more like a private exchange targeting users on Facebook inventory only. Ad Age’s Tim Peterson says a new, open exchange will be facilitated by LiveRail technology (acquired by Facebook last July <http://go.adexchanger.com/FkDBL00DN0W0P2qq000AA04> ) and sell publishers’ mobile app inventory. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0EqkWPO0A00> . LiveRail is moving well beyond enabling the sale of desktop video inventory alone. 

Ad Tech And IPOs 

Positioning itself as a “business intelligence and marketing automation software service” targeting retailers, MaxPoint Interactive raised more than $70 million <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40F0A2q0BPLD0WkP00q0A0>  in its initial public offering on Friday. Nevertheless, the markets frowned on the company’s stock, valuing MXPT <http://go.adexchanger.com/qkAW0A0DLQ004q02B0PG00q>  at $250 million by EOD according to NASDAQ <http://go.adexchanger.com/qkAW0A0DLQ004q02B0PG00q> . Ad tech IPOs continue to be challenged – see TubeMogul’s first day of trading in July <http://go.adexchanger.com/FkDBL00HR0W0P2qq000AA04> ; its stock price has been on a somewhat more  <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DIA02000BWq0q4kSLP0A> positive roller coaster since that time. MaxPoint had originally hoped to raise even more funds according to its S-1 <http://go.adexchanger.com/gJ0D40L0q20kBA0AW000TqP> , which “opens the kimono” (whoa) on 2014 revenues of $106 million with a $13 million loss. Its MaxPoint Intelligence Platform is the backbone of the business and was launched in 2011 <http://go.adexchanger.com/uK0000DB4L0A0U02qPqWAk0> . 

FTC Cross-Device Radar 

In a speech at the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) Privacy Summit in Washington on Thursday, the head of the US Federal Trade Commission, Edith Ramirez, detailed her commission’s goals. Make no mistake, tactics that are becoming part of marketing’s evolution are on the FTC radar. SC Magazine’s Teri Robinson covers the presentation: “[The chairwoman] referred to ‘the focus [President Obama] has placed on privacy’ as ‘tremendous,’ before detailing the commission's goals, particularly data security, sussing out the connections between a data-driven world and fraud and cross-device tracking.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PL40q0DVAkq2> . Also, read Google <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBW000Aqk0A200WL4qPM00>  general counsel Kent Walker’s thoughts on data, privacy and innovation. 

Programmatic Front 

Programmatic TV? Still TBD. But, TV companies are going programmatic. Multichannel News’ Jeff Baumgartner says that Freewheel has added A+E Networks to its “FourFronts” digital video, programmatic pilot. Quoting Freewheel, Baumgartner writes, “The programmatic pilot enables matching of data in a protected escrow environment that lets publishers forecast and reserve against it.” Sounds fancy.

Scrolling For Viewability 

Infinite scrolling, such as what you see when you scroll down your Facebook page, has been thought to provide an answer to viewability concerns and, consequently, adopted by many large publishers.  Unfortunately, Digiday’s Ricardo Bilton sees lip balm on a pig: “[The] tactic, while popular, isn’t entirely foolproof: While ads in infinite scrolling sites are more viewable, the challenge comes when users scroll past the ads before they actually load.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPkO0qq0AD00B4Y020W0> .

Piper Puffs Pandora Programmatic 

Online music service Pandora met with Wall Street analysts this past week and outlined plans for its ad product line among other strategic initiatives. “We see monetization likely being driven by better local sales efforts, increased use of data, better measurement and an emerging programmatic strategy,” puffed the Piper Jaffray analysts in review. Read more on Benzinga <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00QWqA000kPqA00040D2L> . Pandora unveiled mobile programmatic plans in early February. Read that one <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0Rq0Lk0DB010W0q4P20A0A> . Meanwhile, GigaOm says the company will offer a day pass <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02S0002q00kPW04DABAqL0>  to get around ads. Schizo-Pandora? 

Anonymous Login Targeted 

Facebook continues its year-long anonymous login <http://go.adexchanger.com/uT0000DB4L0A0302qPqWAk0>  beta, according to Re/code’s Kurt Wagner. He reminds that the tool is “intended to allow people to test out third-party apps without having to share any personal Facebook information.” To date, apparently, people like to login as themselves and no one is  <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB4000Aqk0A200WL4qPU00> using the feature.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Twitter Adds Shopper Segments 

Twitter added a bevy of new segments, including offline shopper, automotive and other in-market buyer data from Acxiom and Datalogix. Nestle’s Butterfinger used them to target regular buyers of peanut butter candy in-store, resulting in a 52% lift in engagement rates over 2014 averages. The injection of third-party segments comes more than a year after Twitter rolled out first-party data matching (retargeting and CRM data) under its Tailored Audiences program. Blog post. <http://go.adexchanger.com/ykkWDqP00A0LAB504900020>  In other Twitter news, MoPub reports brand advertisers drove a lot more spend in 2014, surpassing performance marketers. Charts. <http://go.adexchanger.com/g60D40L0q20kBA0AW000akP>  

Fraud Fight Fumble 

Linda Woolley is out as head of a new industry body tasked with cleaning up the digital ad ecosystem, just four months after the group was formed. The Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG), a joint effort of the ANA, IAB and 4As, will be led on an interim basis by Mike Zaneis, the IAB's general counsel and head of public policy. Woolley's exit was announced as TAG named a group of 20 highfalutin board members, including CMOs from Keurig, JCPenney and Mondelez. Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/DW7400b0ABD00k0kL02P0Aq>  Related: AdExchanger's coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lk82cADP0k00A0>  of TAG's anti-fraud agenda. 

Peeling The MRC Onion 

The viewability debate has thrusted an ordinarily vanilla topic – measurement accreditation – into the industry spotlight. WSJ’s Mike Shields peeks behind the curtain at the Media Rating Council, the main body charged with putting a stamp of approval on measurement providers, and finds an organization struggling to make the best of a difficult situation. “They are accrediting so many companies so quickly, but they don’t have the power to dictate very deep in the technology, which is making standardization across these companies very challenging,” he said. “The frustration in the industry is palpable.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/lkBqd000LkDP0A2A400090W>  Related: MRC accredits GroupM and Unilever’s tougher viewability metric. Read that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ak0e04WB200AkPq00L0a0DA>  

Predictive Products 

Salesforce.com pumped Predictive Decisions into its Marketing Cloud, what SVP of product marketing Eric Stahl described to AdExchanger as a feature combining known and anonymous information about a user in order to trigger predictive recommendations across apps, email and sites. In tandem, it launched a tool called “Collect Beacons,” which streams data in real time, whether from web analytics or point of sale, and mashes it up with CRM data. “We’ve only recently begun leveraging ExactTarget’s capabilities from its acquisition of iGoDigital, so this is integrating their algorithms and data science into our marketing execution platform,” Stahl said. <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWk4kA00fL0PB0b2>  Press release.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Two Buzzwords In One 

Rubicon Project and InMobi have teamed up on a native ad server for mobile. Publishers can direct sell mobile, native campaigns using the technology, and also backfill with programmatic demand. The announcement comes in the wake of new specs for OpenRTB 2.3, which includes a protocol for native ads. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0f0P4qA02000WLz0y0AkDB> . In related news, InMobi launched something on Wednesday it’s calling “Appographic Targeting,” a tool which allows advertisers to segment users based on individual app interests rather than categories or broad demographics. “The lifetime value is much higher when you’re able to target users with the apps they really use,” Atul Satija, InMobi’s VP of revenue and ops, told AdExchanger at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Wednesday. VentureBeat has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWf4kA00zL0PB0A2> . 

No Soup For You 

Wal-Mart has pulled the plug on a data-sharing arrangement with Google that exposed local product availability to shoppers, The Wall Street Journal reports. According to the story, “The retailer pulled out over concerns about sharing store inventory and pricing data with Google, according to two people familiar with the situation.” Wal-Mart was sharing the sensitive data to inform Google’s Local Inventory Ads. Macy’s and Office Depot are reportedly among those still supplying their store inventory data. Read more. <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00fB0ALAWPAkB02q000>  

The Digital Sales Unicorn 

Ad sales ain’t what it used to be. Ad Age writes about the challenges faced by publishers as programmatic spending increases. Many are laying off people who don’t have technical chops, and hiring those that do. BuzzFeed, for example, hired its president, Greg Coleman, from Criteo, and Condé Nast hired away BuzzFeed data scientist Ky Harlin. Bloomberg requires its salespeople to pass IAB training and sell across radio, digital, TV and print. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0kB0B4L0C2AAP00q0Df00> . 

Pair with this AdExchanger column on programmatic sales models of the future <http://go.adexchanger.com/jquB0k2LW004D0P0AAv0f00> . 

TV Acceleration 

In a piece for Adweek, The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green poses a question: “Is programmatic advertising in TV going to be adopted slowly, like color, or quickly, like nearly all other major changes over the past two decades of TV?” He comes down on the side of speed over deliberation, citing consumers’ rapid adoption of on-demand addressable entertainment options. Future, commence! Read the column. <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0k00fqCD>  

Digitally Savvy CIOs 

CIOs used to be confined to the inner workings of the enterprise, but according to Forrester analyst Nigel Fenwick, they’re playing a bigger role in the digital transformation of their organizations. A growing number of savvy CIOs – think Starbucks’ former CIO, Stephen Gillett – are being brought in now on business strategy discussions. “CIOs with experience in marketing and/or business-unit leadership – especially eBusiness – are well-equipped to lead the digital transformation journey in many companies,” Fenwick wrote.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

App-quisition Sets Up Purch For Mobile 

Purch bought the price-comparison and barcode-scanning app Consumr on Tuesday. The mobile app adds to Purch’s portfolio of websites that target consumers with high intent to purchase (like review site Top Ten Reviews). “Consumr is an important piece of our overall mobile strategy that will help consumers make complex buying decisions on the screen of their choice,” Purch COO Doug Llewellyn told AdExchanger. Long-term, the company plans to fully integrate the app with its commerce properties and offer its marketing players extension into the platform. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q09A0DB0WQ2Lq00kA00J4P0> . 

Dissolving Desk 

The partial dissolution of Publicis Groupe’s trading desk, VivaKi AOD, felt just a little bit momentous for close observers of agencies' programmatic efforts. And, as Marco Bertozzi, VivaKi’s president of global clients, hints in an interview with Digiday, it's also smart business. “Clients don’t trust the concept of a trading desk anymore. ... The general sentiment is that this was definitely the right move. It’s going to be quite a tough argument for another agency to go up against in this current climate.” Gauntlet, thrown! Read more. <http://go.adexchanger.com/GkB0A920DK4RW0AL0000P0q>  

Ad Tech’s For Kids 

A UK startup called SuperAwesome has built an ad platform for the express purpose of honoring COPPA, the US privacy law prohibiting collection of PII from kids. WSJ’s Mike Shields writes, “Essentially, it’s ad tech designed explicitly to not collect any data on kids or target them based on their behavior in any way. That means it does essentially the opposite of what most online advertising technology is designed to do.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBL000A9k0A200WL4qPS00>  

Short Shelf Life 

Notoriously struggling ecommerce startup Fab.com has finally been snapped up – by custom manufacturing firm PCH. As Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PMB00000A94Dq02kWT0>  first reported, the flash-sale design site was nearing a fire sale of the business back in November. Fab.com was heavily venture-backed, having raised some $300 million in its five-year lifespan and lived, albeit shakily, through several pivots and mass layoffs under the watch of its outspoken co-founder, Jason Goldberg. According to GeekWire <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBN000A9k0A200WL4qPU00> , 35 employees from Fab.com will join PCH, Goldberg will exit and GM Renee Wong will lead day-to-day operations. Undisclosed funds from the cash and equity transaction will go toward Hem, Goldberg’s new furniture upstart. The official announcement <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0k0VWD0L4PO0A2q090BA00> .

Available inventory is opportunistic, remnant airtime, meaning that pricing is cheaper than it would be for upfront or scatter buys..."

Thus, it could encourage traditional media owners to relinquish more inventory to automated channels, since broadcasters can prove engagement and price accordingly..."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Native And The SSP 

PubMatic has added support for “programmatic native.” The offering will at first be limited to RTB and private marketplace integration, with the eventual goal of enabling “automated guaranteed” transactions. PubMatic’s buy-side partners include Adelphic, Bidtellect, Digilant, Fiksu, MediaMath, PowerLinks, StrikeAd and Turn. The solution works for mobile web, in-app and desktop native ads. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqnP04A0LB0WA202k0000BD> . Native ad ops: just like display! 

Buying B2B 

There’s a run on B2B data companies and Madison Logic is the latest to join the race. The B2B marketing solutions provider moved in on B2B ad network BBN, an acquisition the company says will add upper-funnel smarts to its predominantly lower- to mid-funnel product mix. BBN’s roots date back to 2008, when 24/7 Real Media, prior to its merger with Xaxis, banded together with four B2B-focused publishers to create the vertically focused network. In other B2B data deal-making, LinkedIn earlier acquired Bizo, while Dun & Bradstreet scooped up NetProspex. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00CWqA000kP2A0o040D2L> . 

Hearst Taps Agency Brass 

Hearst-owned agency iCrossing has found a new CEO in Nick Brien, the former chief of McCann Worldgroup who left 2012. Brien will also run Hearst Magazines Marketing Services. He said in a statement, "We are fueled by the vast content, audience and data assets of Hearst.” Those data assets include Core Audience, the publisher's DMP that used to be known as Red Aril. Brien was shown the exit at McCann after IPG brass decided his direct marketing background and brash style didn't fit McCann's creative-centric agency network. Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00p0DL02W00AD2q0kA04>  

Tomorrow’s Data Monopolies 

In a piece for the Harvard Business Review, Kira Radinsky argues the future will find large companies using their data sets to freeze out competitors. “Data becomes the barrier-to-entry to the market and thus prevents new competitors from entering. As a result of the established player’s access to vast amounts of proprietary data, overall industry competitiveness suffers. This hurts the economy.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/qkAW0A0DLq004202B0PE00q>  Google’s search dominance is the obvious web example. But! The ad market would seem insulated, with data ownership inherently fragmented across brands and publishers. And onboarding of new data sources could give a boost to offline players. 

Local-Market Measurement 

Tribune Broadcasting inked a long-term renewal of Nielsen’s local-market TV ratings for measurement across its stations. Terms weren’t disclosed, but Tribune will take advantage of newer Nielsen offerings like mobile TV and out-of-home metrics. “Expanding our access to more detailed audience research and analytics is extremely important to our company,” said Larry Wert, president of broadcast media for Tribune. Even Nielsen, the poster child for prime-time TV, is investing in video and mobile. The blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0kqW0D00rAFB024PA> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Comcast Shops For Advanced TV

Comcast is in talks to buy TV ad-targeting firm Visible World, according to The Wall Street Journal’s sources. Visible World, parent company to AudienceXpress, has raised $33 million to date. “One of Visible World’s biggest strengths, marketing executives say, is its technology that allows advertisers to simply and inexpensively create custom versions of TV commercials that are targeted to cable viewers,” according the the Journal article, co-authored by Shalini Ramachandran and Mike Shields. “For example, advertisers can change creative content in commercials such as shifting offers or images based on things such as household data or even weather in a particular market.” The deal would echo Comcast’s $320 million FreeWheel acquisition last year, though sources say the deal is not yet imminent.

Full-Funnel Makeover

In an interview with Street Fight <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0j04WD0L4PM0A2q0Z0BA00> , Simplifi boss Frost Prioleau talks about how localized programmatic advertising is changing the measurement game. “The definition of full-funnel attribution models is expanding,” Prioleau said. “Not only are companies able to track attribution from other digital advertising or conversion to online, but we’re also starting to see attribution from purchases offline through CRM data linking and also through physical visits to a store by tracking beacons or GPS location. … It used to be full-funnel was just online activity. Now we’re seeing full-funnel include offline activity as well.” Simplifi offers a programmatic ad platform specializing in localized marketing.

Mmmm, Beacons

Mobile analytics firm Kochava snapped up InferSystems to enhance its mobile ad optimization chops. InferSystem is a predictive analytics software company, and Kochava will use its tech to distill campaign data from ad networks and publishers. “Moving forward, measurement has to include optimization,” Kochava CEO Charles Manning told TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP05N02q0L0AB0Dj00AZ4> . “Because if you don’t, you’re not taking into account all the data you’re collecting.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq06jA00OZD0AP00040> .

Visa Commerce

Visa unveiled plans to buy TrialPay, an ecommerce payments platform that also deals in advertising. Visa is eager to strengthen its ties with merchants and provide them with the data. “TrialPay will strengthen our loyalty and offers platform, which we expect to become a strategic and competitive differentiator that can help merchants build customer loyalty and increase sales in both the digital and physical retail environments,” commented Ramon Martin, Visa SVP of merchant sales and solutions, in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPj70Zq0AD00B4P020W0> .

Programmatic + Native

Choicestream VP Sabine Cummins chats about the programmatic native opportunity in an interview with Ad Ops Online. “It enables the configuration of advertiser content with publisher content to occur instantaneously,” she said. “It also allows brands to target audiences and fine-tune inventory purchase decisions based on first and third-party data sources.” What’s next for programmatic native? “I believe that video ad formats will be included in the inventory available, as more sites create their content around snackable videos,” Cummins predicts.
