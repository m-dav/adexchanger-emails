 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Viewability Nonstarter 

Ad buyers and trading groups are pushing back against the IAB’s proposed viewability standards. In an open letter published last week, the IAB claimed that 100% viewability measurement is an impossibility, and that advertisers should aim instead for 70% viewability. But on Friday the 4A’s published a letter of its own, claiming it will “not endorse” the IAB’s guidelines. Magna Global EVP Todd Gordon adds, “Running a campaign and paying for 30% of the ads not being viewable isn’t acceptable to us or our clients.” More via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBu000Ang0A200WL4qPr00> . 

Mobile-Local Winnowing 

Speaking to Street Fight about the future of mobile-local advertising, Thinknear GM Loren Hillberg says consolidation is on the horizon. Mergers will come “at least as much from a strategic perspective as … from a scale perspective. I do think there will be a couple winners on the mobile side who will have a chance to be really scaled up entities that deliver value long-term. I’d have a hard time picking those people today.” Thinknear, whose parent company is Telenav, specializes in location-based and targeted mobile advertising. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0gvA0000q0Ds20LAWn>  

Prioritizing Programmatic 

Dennis Publishing will pursue programmatic and native ad strategies in 2015, Dennis Digital managing director Pete Wootton tells The Drum. “If you take our app strategy then it's increasingly looking at how it relates to our responsive web design and mobile web strategy. If we don’t look at these things as being intertwined then there’s a risk of chasing the same audience in two different ways.” Everything is connected. Dennis titles include The Week, Men’s Fitness and Mental Floss. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PwB00000An4Dq02gWt0> . 

The Second Stream 

Facebook quietly introduced a separate news feed to its mobile application on Monday that’s visible to a limited number of users. A tab titled “Find Apps” leads those users to a stream of app-install and engagement ads. “We’re always looking for ways to help people discover apps that are relevant for them, as well as opportunities for advertisers to reach these people, so we’re exploring a few new places to surface apps we think people will be interested in,” a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0un0Lg0DB0x0W0q4P20A0A> . Facebook says that CPCs, CPIs and eCPMs in its app-install news feed will reflect what advertisers are charged for ad placements in the regular news feed. 

Dave Morgan’s Crystal Ball 

Simulmedia CEO Dave Morgan, a founding father of ad tech, maintains that the TV ad business is warming up to programmatic, and that a weaker-than-expected TV ad market is fueling the change. “As cable nets, the broadcast nets, [and] the distributors recognize that they can yield significantly more revenue cost effectively by packaging it differently, they’ll do it that way,” he said.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

AppNexus Shops Again 

AppNexus acquired cross-device advertising startup MediaGlu, bringing its combined M&A outlay this year to a whopping $200 million (most of it spent on ad server Open AdStream). “We have a tremendous opportunity to redefine how advertising on the Internet works,” AppNexus CEO Brian O’Kelley told Forbes <http://go.adexchanger.com/ub0000DB4L0A0a02jPqWAg0> . “And a lot of that means buying key technologies.” But O’Kelley’s gunning for an IPO. “I look forward to being public because we can stop talking about who is bigger,” he said. “I think our story is better transparent than it is opaque.” Speaking of transparency, read AdExchanger’s feature <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0cj0Lg0DB0b0W0q4P20A0A>  on AppNexus’ fraud woes. 

Inside YouTube 

In a deep dive on YouTube and its chief, Susan Wojcicki, The New York Times portrays the video service as a “cultural force” with (so far) limited upside. With $1.1 billion in 2014 ad revenue, it still amounts to less than a hundredth of the traditional TV market. “Despite YouTube’s size, a tiny fraction of it is what we call ‘TV replaceable,’ content where we would take TV money and swap it over to YouTube,” said a source. “It’s a funny thing to be sitting on top of something this massive and not really be able to totally control what you’re selling advertising against.” YouTube is experimenting with subscription-based services as another way to monetize. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0g0dWD0L4Pc0A2q0j0BA00> . 

Next Year’s Changes 

Speaking to The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0ej0Lg0DB0d0W0q4P20A0A> , Financial Times ad ops director Anthony Hitchings sees a price shift on the horizon within programmatic buying, and he predicts a disintermediation of SSPs. “Expect to see a change in the structure of tech fees with a shift toward a CPM fee rather than a percentage share,” he said. “Branding spend will see a move from an auction model to a programmatic guaranteed model. There is potential as this happens for the supply-side platforms ... to become redundant. Instead demand-side platforms could be integrated directly with publisher ad servers on a CPM model and allowed to cherry pick impressions.” 

Facebook, Hit Maker 

Facebook's six-month-old mobile ad network may be the rare case when the company nails an ad product on the first try. According to a Fiksu study, Audience Network delivers strong performance at a fraction of the cost of other mobile display networks. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqeP04A0LB0WAj02g0000fD> . The WSJ picks up the research, focusing on the difference between FAN and the Facebook news feed. The latter had significantly higher response rates. But! "The conversion rate [for Facebook Audience Network] was much higher -- 26.28% for the ad network, versus 16.61% for ads on Facebook." Read that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0gj0Lg0DB0f0W0q4P20A0A>  

History Repeating 

In his final piece for The New York Times, ad columnist Stuart Elliott looks back at a quarter century of advertising and concludes the only constant is change. “As transformative as recent changes have been for the advertising business,” he writes, “are they more wrenching than the disruption caused by the rapid rise of television as an ad medium in the 1950s?” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/gh0D40L0q20gBA0AW000gjP> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Merger Talk 

Do Yahoo and AOL belong together? Some Yahoo shareholders are trying hard to make the case, as Business Insider reporter Nicholas Carlson reports in The New York Times Magazine. These investors have advanced spreadsheets "that calculate that AOL and Yahoo are worth between 70 and 80 percent more when combined than they are apart.” The prospect is enticing to some who have lost faith in Mayer’s leadership vision and would like to see Tim Armstrong in charge of Yahoo. But even if Mayer and Armstrong could be won over, how to fit together all the overlapping parts (e.g., Adap.tv/BrightRoll)? Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPg00eq0AD00B4U020W0> . 

Tracking The Store Visit 

Google is letting advertisers PetSmart and Office Depot measure brick-and-mortar visits and link those back to digital ad exposure. The capability is an add-on to AdWords' Estimated Total Conversions solution, which also looks at phone calls and ad exposure across devices. “It's more important than ever for businesses to understand the impact that search ads have in driving visits to your physical locations, whether that’s a store, hotel, auto dealership or restaurant,” says a blog post.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B01egWPV0A00> . 2015…the year of attribution. 

Kraft Changes 

A CEO shuffle is brewing at Kraft Foods. On Thursday, the company revealed Chairman John Cahill will take over for CEO Tony Vernon, effective next week. The move came as a surprise to analysts, according to the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P240e0DWAgq2> . “The industry is undergoing a great deal of rapid change,” said Cahill in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0eA0DB0W32Lq00gA00X4P0> , “and it is important that we keep pace and indeed stay ahead of these changes as we build a stronger Kraft.” Those changes include marketing, where Kraft is aggressively bringing its first-party data to bear.

Where TV Ends And Video Begins 

Videology CEO Scott Ferber says programmatic TV requires three components. "It needs to be automated, data-driven and cross-device, meaning it’s not just the living room TV set,” he told Beet.TV at the TV Of Tomorrow show in New York City. “I think it will start at the traditional linear … television-buying groups inside the large agency holding companies."

Datalogix Reality Check 

In early December we reported that data solutions company Datalogix has been looking for a buyer, and investors hope to get as much as $1 billion. In a follow-up story, PE HUB’s sources suggest the exit will come in at around $375 million to $500 million. “[Datalogix] raised capital in the Spring at a post money above $600 million,” said one PE HUB source, identified as a banker. “Hard to imagine them selling for anything below that level.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B06egWP00A00> .

Retail Consolidation 

E-tail giant CommerceHub will wrangle some retail tech, acquiring Mercent for an undisclosed sum. Mercent CEO Eric Best will remain in his post and report to CommerceHub CEO Frank Poore. “By combining CommerceHub and Mercent, we will have an offering that enables retailers to radically expand their product assortment, generate greater demand, and optimize customer delivery from any source of supply – including stores, warehouses, drop-shippers or third-party sellers,” Poore said in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/u80000DB4L0A0202ePqWAg0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

HP’s Behind The Wheel 

HP is on a quest to take control of its programmatic buying and force pricing transparency in its automated dealings, Ad Age reports. HP’s programmatic and media planning business sits with Omnicom, whose Accuen trading desk has come under fire for its lack of transparency. “Hewlett Packard intends to take direct contractual control of their technology partnerships,” the company stated in an RFI, adding that “[f]uture plans include scaling our programmatic deployment across a growing number of marketing programs as well as supporting our ecommerce business geographically." Also raised in the RFI were concerns about ad fraud and the need to protect data privacy. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/yg9WDqP00A0LABj04800020> . 

WPP’s New Chairman 

WPP named Roberto Quarta as the holding company’s next chairman. Quarta will join WPP’s board on Jan. 1 and officially succeed WPP’s current chairman, Philip Lader, at the annual shareholder meeting in June. WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrel said, “[Quarta’s] experience and background complement and will help develop WPP’s strategy in new markets, in new media, in data investment management and the application of technology and, last but not least, horizontality.” Read on via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/uk0000DB4L0A09029PqWAg0> . 

YouTube Challenger 

The industry’s been waiting with great curiosity for ex-Hulu CEO Jason Kilar to unwrap his Internet-video company, Vessel, and on Wednesday the firm announced deals with a handful of media outlets, including YouTube networks Machinima and Tastemade, the Warner Music Group and select YouTube vloggers. With Vessel, Kilar is betting the company can increase online video ad rates with exclusive premium content accessible through a pay gate. “Early access is valuable,” Kilar told The New York Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0l9gWPa0A00> . “Consumers very much want and are willing to pay a reasonable amount for early access to content; that allows you to build a great business.” But time will tell if consumers are willing to dish out for sneak peeks. 

The Only Media Model? 

In an interview with Digiday, media columnist Michael Wolff shares some predictions for digital media in 2015. “There’s going to be a dawning understanding that that’s what digital media is: You’re in the direct-response business,” he said. “The native content business is basically responding to that. How do we get out of this? There’s only one media model that works, and that’s television.” On this point Wolff is bullish, unequivocally adding that “[e]verybody in digital media will be trying to get into the television business.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D009m0ALAWPbgB02q000> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google Seeks Fulfillment 

Google is talking with retail partners about a “buy” button and a two-day shipping option for products sold through its shopping platform, the WSJ reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D004s0ALAWPcgB02q000> . “Amazon is increasingly running away with online retail in North America, which poses a huge problem for Google,” said Bessemer Venture Partners e-commerce investor Jeremy Levine. “Google has to get in front of this and create a reasonable alternative.” Pair with AdExchanger’s coverage of buy-button mania <http://go.adexchanger.com/GgB0A420Dd4tW0AL0000P0q> . E-tail competition heats up! 

Dentsu Buys Attribution 

In a play to beef up its data-analytics and attribution-modeling capabilities, Dentsu-owned iProspect snatched up Rockett Interactive on Tuesday. The acquisition comes after Dentsu Aegis agreed to buy content-marketing agency Covario in September. “In today’s convergent world, every screen can become a transaction point,” said iProspect US President Jeremy Cornfeldt. “For performance marketing to drive results, you must have total visibility into both your client’s business and the complexity around the consumer journey.” The acquisition, he said, will enable iProspect “to holistically understand the impact a client’s media spending has on consumer behaviours not directly connected to a sale.” Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q04A0DB0Wu2Lq00gA00e4P0> .

In an interview with Marketing Interactive, Forbes CEO Mike Perlis goes into defense mode regarding his company’s native advertising model. ”If managed correctly and transparently with clear identification and high standards for that content, I think native advertising adds to sources for content that people are so hungry for,” he said, “Unfortunately, people who simply sell ads by allowing people to run [content] that does not meet the standards that I just described – that’s what gives native advertising an advertorial feel.” Perlis insists that Forbes’s four-year-old native content arm, Brand Voice,was designed as a tool for thought leadership, not as a platform for selling products.

Selling Mobile 

Twitter has begun letting mobile-app developers target users who have recently activated new phones, a group considered prime targets in the oversaturated app ecosystem. And it’s letting advertisers target Twitter users according to which wireless carrier they use, a feature primarily of value to the carriers themselves. Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02w000g400gPW04DABAqL0> . And, read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PhBxD000qA2404L0g> . It’s a mobile world, Twitter's just living in it. 

Worlds Collide 

TripleLift has integrated its native ad platform with numerous demand-side platforms (DSP), including AppNexus, MediaMath, TheTradeDesk, and Turn. CEO Eric Berry proclaims in a press release, “This is the first time that a DSP, using its existing media-buying infrastructure, can buy native ads at scale.” Microsoft Store is the first brand to try the tool, which resulted in a 475% return on ad spend for its native real-time bidding campaign.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

What Vice’s $500M Will Buy 

Speaking to the Financial Times, Vice chief Shane Smith said his company is gearing up for a “deal spree” in 2015, in the wake of its $500 million monster round led by A&E Networks. “Theoretically, if we’re doing $1bn of top line revenue and thirty to thirty five per cent margins …?what media offering has there been like that in the last decade?” he said. Vice recently beefed up its senior management team, bringing James Schwab on board as co-president to manage mergers and acquisitions of content, technology and distribution companies. “We would be stupid not to think about an IPO,” added Smith.

Rabbit Ears Adjustment 

GroupM’s newly launched TV unit Modi is working with Videology to deliver addressable TV ads programmatically. Speaking to Beet.TV at the TV of Tomorrow Show, Modi senior partner Jamie Power says addressable TV has arrived. “We’re in 42 million households this year. That number’s going to grow to about 60 million households next year,” she said, adding that “there are definitely advertisers that are better suited for addressability. It relays on the data that’s available,” pointing to the auto and entertainment industries as strong players. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PMB6D000qA2004L0g> . 

Native Ads 

Former AppNexus CTO and co-founder Mike Nolet reprises his days of writing for his eponymous Mike On Ads <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq07gA00N0D0AP00040>  blog with a post on LinkedIn titled “Native advertising is killing the net.”  He sees spam-ridden content and concludes, “I strongly urge both native advertising companies and content producers to reconsider what sort of links they allow before consumer trust in editorial content disappears.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/r4080A200BOLD0WgP00q0A0> . 

Publisher Rx 

Writing for The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/u90000DB4L0A0P020PqWAg0> , AOL Platforms Global CEO Bob Lord advises publishers to embrace programmatic. “Used on the sell side, programmatic technologies will continue to transition from being used as an 'efficiency/savings' assist to a dominant means of driving more effectiveness and better outcomes,” Lord predicts. “Smart publishers will employ techniques like audience extension, retargeting and more to augment their offerings.” Lord names eBay as an example of a forward-thinking, programmatically inclined publisher as the e-tailer gears up to make mobile ads available programmatically in 2015. 

Betting On The IOT 

China’s largest smartphone vendor, Xiaomi, is investing a whopping $203.7 million in home appliances firm Midea Group, in a play to deepen its dealings in the connected device space. But Reuters reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0a0gWPQ0A00>  that the company’s revenues are on thin ice. “They’re growing so fast and so lean, I wouldn’t be surprised even if they were losing money,” says Forrester Research analyst Bryan Wang. “The current market is so competitive that I don’t think it’s sustainable without consolidation.” In any case, Xiaomi seems determined to challenge US companies’ lead in connected devices – and their associated data.

Total Self Serve 

Mobile ad network Todacell rolled out a self-serve product, dubbed Todaself. The company claims to reach 250 million users globally and works with some heavyweights like eBay and Samsung. Todacell’s platform leverages the usual data points (location, time and device info), along with some non-mobile data sources such as sociogeographic and economic intel. Todacell CEO Amir Goldstein claims Todaself is the “first self-service mobile ad solution to integrate advanced mobile campaign optimization.” Inside Mobile Apps has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0gT0B4L0d2AAP00q0D000> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic TV, Actually 

Programmatic TV is having a moment, with TubeMogul’s recent reveal of a television buying product and ESPN’s auction model for some TV ads <http://go.adexchanger.com/GfB0AW20Dn4MW0AL0000P0q> , but to some it’s “lots of talk.” AdAge rounds up some skeptical POVs, including GroupM’s top TV buyer, Rino Scanzoni, who says, “What is considered programmatic in digital is not taking place in the TV world.” ESPN’s Eric Johnson allows that "You're not going to replicate the exact mechanism and data targeting on TV that exists online.” But! “ We are moving in that direction as we build out these systems.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pfo00q2N0W> . 

Programmatic Consult 

Omnicom media agency Manning Gottlieb OMD is building a programmatic consulting team. The small group of UK-based consultants, led by director Katie Eyton, aims to transcend the suspicion that has surrounded trading desks. “We’re taking a step back from the trading desk environment and looking ahead to the future,” Eyton told Digiday. “Like any agency group, we have preferred partners, but [the consulting team] is not tied down to any one supplier. Our advice will be technology agnostic.” Eyton added the group has already helped one client vet a DSP. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PpDWA40LfB00OA> . 

Nonlinear Dreams 

The Trade Desk pulled in $45 million in debt financing on Friday as it looks to steer into nonlinear video channels like apps and VOD. The DSP was founded by Jeff Green, founder of AdECN (which Microsoft bought some seven years ago). “We think 2015 will be a massive year for [programmatic] television, and things are beginning to change,” Green told the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DfBqA0020P0WPAWq00> . “You’re already seeing some of the linear shops making moves in programmatic TV. Those [networks] won’t be the only deals. It’s going to take a long time for some but you don’t have to get a massive shift in television for the dollars to get significant.” 

Search Party 

Search is once more a battlefield, with Yahoo and Facebook renewing their focus on it in recent months. Facebook quietly dropped general search results from Bing, Reuters reported Friday. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0QW0Lf0DB0r0W0q4P20A0A>  The move comes shortly after Yahoo won a bid to become the default search provider on Mozilla’s Firefox browser, a contract long held by Google. There’s no intent like search intent. 

More Vendors, More Problems 

Speaking with TechCrunch, The Mobile Majority CEO Rob Emrich says his company is trying to solve the “trust issues” that riddle the mobile ad ecosystem. Viewability, Emrich tells TechCrunch, is “almost like playing a game of telephone, and it gets worse the more vendors you need to use. In order to really diagnose what’s going on, you really need to be able to look at the entire system.” He says the company has 50 employees and is on a $50 million run rate.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

2015: Smarter Machines 

Big data: so very 2014. Next year “machine intelligence” could be the magical phrase around which a wave of startups find their footing. With a new landscape chart, Bloomberg Beta investor Shivon Zilis lays out some of the AI and “deep learning” players whose more perfect algorithms will transform sectors and perhaps start some new ones. In the ad and publishing categories, she holds up Rocket Fuel, Metamarkets, Dstillery and Outbrain, among others. Gentlemen, start your M&A engines. Survey the landscape. <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0fqW0D00vAYB0S4PA>  

Clearing The Fog 

Speaking to The Drum, Quantcast marketing chief Amit Kotecha speculates on the next big thing for programmatic. As brands move away from last-touch attribution, Kotecha says cross-device attribution is on deck. “Being able to see how every user saw your ads on each of their devices and how each channel affected the other will be a big deal for the industry and is the holy grail for programmatic trading,” he said. The two main barriers to marketers adopting programmatic trading, according to Kotecha, are tech and education. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PwBZD000qA2S04L0f> . 

Funding Publisher Video 

Woven Digital, parent company to Uproxx and Brobible, completed an $18 million Series A round. Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00TA0L0D000fB2qW0AyP04>  that the publisher intends for its video business, Woven Studios, to make up 50% of its revenue. Woven Studios has made branded videos for MillerCoors, Sony Pictures and Electronic Arts, and CEO Scott Grimes said the studio will begin producing its own content as well. Woven also plans to invest more in tech, in order to keep up with rivals BuzzFeed, Vox and others. 

Team Viewability 

Data meets measurement. Nielsen plans to combine the demographic data in its Online Campaign Ratings with Moat’s analytics products. The result: Moat can now give advertiser and publisher clients access to Nielsen’s campaign measurement capabilities. It’s the first time that Moat has integrated third-party ad audience reporting, but arguably it won’t be the last. As viewability takes center stage – up there with the fraud issue – there’s more pressure on vendors to provide metrics around attention. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWT4fA00zL0PB012> . 

Driving Actions Off Facebook 

Facebook is adding new call-to-action buttons for Pages, including “sign up,” “shop now,” and “book now.” Trial customer Dollar Shave Club achieved “a 2.5x higher conversion rate versus other comparable social placements aimed to drive new user acquisition,” said its director of acquisition, Brian Kim. The buttons will roll out in the US in the weeks to come, and will be available worldwide in 2015. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PADTA40LfB002A> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Seller Report Card 

Ad analytics startup Pixalate surfaced its first monthly Global Seller Trust Index, rating marketplaces for ad quality. Google, OpenX and Rubicon Project rated highly for viewability, fraud and ad engagement. Millennial Media, Yahoo and AOL, meanwhile, have continuing issues. “This is a supply chain management problem and it will encourage good sellers to be ranked high and lower ranking sellers to invest in their supply quality management departments,” Pixalate CEO Jalal Nasir told Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tf0WP0P0f000DBL20L4qAA0> . Next up from Pixalate will be two forthcoming indices, one on website quality and a second looking at DSPs and buy-side platforms. Blog post. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tg0WP0P0f000DBM20L4qAA0>  

Amazon’s Creative APIs 

Amazon Media Group debuted a Trusted Creative Partner Program,allowing select agencies to create and execute campaigns for Amazon’s ecommerce ads and its Fire tablets. “This is e-commerce, and this is marketing in a digitized world,” Mark Renshaw, chief innovation officer of Leo Burnett and Arc Worldwide, told Ad Age. “First and foremost this trusted status gives us a greater ability to go to market, a greater ability to move quickly." Other partners include POSSIBLE, Rockfish and TeaLab. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0P0P4qA02000WLN0h0AfDB> . 

Building The Native Hooks 

Berlin-based SSP PubNative says it now supports native formats from any mobile ad network or DSP. “More than 90 percent of mobile demand does not support native formats," explained PubNative co-founder Ionut Ciobotaru. "Our technology tackles this challenge by enabling all programmatic demand sources to effortlessly access native inventory.” Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/lPBqi000LfDP0A2A4000O0W> . 

$600B In Ads 

eMarketer projects global ad spend in 2015 will overtake 2014 spend by 6%, spurred by (what else) digital and mobile. Mobile ads will draw an estimated $64 billion next year and more than double that by 2018, making up 22.3% of all ad spend worldwide. The upward revision is “due chiefly to faster-than-expected growth in China’s mobile ad market.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0PPfWPj0A00> . 

Instagram Advances 

Instagram crossed 300 million users and debuted a verification badge for brands and celebrities. With verified badges, Instagram hopes to weed out spammers and imposter accounts. Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PkB00000AP4Dq02fWQ0> . The NYT points out <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0RP0Lf0DB0l0W0q4P20A0A>  that this puts Instagram’s user base above Twitter’s. But when will Instagram leverage Facebook’s data regime for Instagram targeting? No word on that yet.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Viewability And Beyond 

Responding to Google’s benchmark viewability data, Dentsu Aegis UK chief executive Tracy de Groose says advertisers are focused on accountability more than viewability. “The shift is not in the viewability of ads; it's increasingly about being able to pay for results, so advertisers don’t need to worry about which bit is seen or not,” de Groose told The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWe400F0ABD00M0fL02P0Aq> . “You only pay for the ads that are tangibly making a difference. I think clients are very aware that this is where we’re moving to. It’s why you’re seeing more ad budgets flowing through digital channels because there’s more accountability.” Read AdExchanger’s coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0fGA0q0f0BAL0PDM2>  Google’s data. 

App Retargeting, Twitter Style 

Twitter has a new way for advertisers to target ads based on available mobile data (think app installs or in-app purchases). “In app engagement campaigns, you can use tailored audiences from mobile apps to connect with users at specific stages of your app marketing funnel,” the company explained in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0gM0Lf0DB0H0W0q4P20A0A> . “For instance, you can target users who have installed your app but have not yet signed up or made a purchase.” Twitter’s been testing the feature with a handful of brands, including mobile rebate firm Ibotta. 

Mozilla Diaries 

Darren Herman joined Mozilla one year ago to develop an ad model for the Firefox browser, and it’s been a wild ride. In a Medium post, Herman chronicles his struggles with internal animus to advertising, which peaked in the wake of a presentation at the IAB Leadership Summit, he writes. “Maybe an hour after I walked off stage, the reality of my new role set in to Mozilla. Mozillians, the community, and many users erupted at me, almost like the human immune system reacting with a toxin.” Herman eventually tendered his resignation, but then had a change of heart. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0hM0Lf0DB0I0W0q4P20A0A>  

Brewers Imbibe YouTube Media 

Big beer brands are pouring ad spend into YouTube, according to Strike Social. Over the past 12 months, Strike Social counts more than $23 million spent on YouTube spots by leading beer vendors, with Bud Light racking up a whopping 120 million digital views. Budweiser, for its part, earned the highest level of engagement, at 57.2 million earned views on 106 million total views. “Total views are a misleading metric for YouTube performance because they can represent promotion on the part of the brand, not audience engagement,” said Strike Social CEO Patrick McKenna. “Earned views tell you which brand had the most engaging content, and it is audience engagement that drives sales.” Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00J0iL0MW00AD2q0fA04> . 

eSports Ads Live 

Amazon-owned Twitch will buy e-sports ad agency GoodGame, VentureBeat reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqKB0f2LW004D0P0AAj0M00> . GoodGame has helped channel more than $10 million to players, teams and tournaments within the e-sports arena, and to date has done so without raising any funding. “This is a nascent space,” Kevin Lin, Twitch chief operating officer, told VentureBeat. “We have hired a sales team and dabbled in content creation. That has worked out well, and we have watched from afar as Alex [Garfield, GoodGame CEO] has grown the business.” Advertisers take note: Something’s brewing in the live gaming ecosystem, and Yahoo’s clearly looking to capitalize on that opportunity.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

AdBlock Battle 

Two French publishers, GESTE and the French IAB, are considering suing Eyeo GmbH, creators of AdBlock Plus, on the grounds that the software poses a threat to the advertising ecosystem. The legal proceedings are still in the consulting stage, with a formal complaint yet to be filed. In an installment for Monday Note, Frédéric Filloux explores what the legal action means for the digital ad market at large, and claims that “the rise of ad blockers is the offspring of two major trends: a continual deflation of digital ads economics, and the growing reliance on ad exchanges and Real Time Bidding, both pushing prices further down.” The “race to the bottom” meme ain’t dead yet. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/yfGWDqP00A0LABV04g00020> . 

Nielsen On Trial 

With linear TV faltering, Nielsen is under pressure to reinvent. But measuring video consumption on OTT devices, desktop and mobile is easier said than done, Ad Age’s Jeanine Poggi reports in a feature on the company. For example, “while Nielsen said in September it is now capable of measuring mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, industry executives said that's not exactly accurate. The software that must be implemented is filled with bugs, according to these executives, and tests of the system have been postponed several times.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWW400h0ABD00G0fL02P0Aq>  Related: In case you missed it last week, Nielsen has shown interest in acquiring Datalogix.

Half-Year Results 

A report from Strategy Analytics details how 44 of the largest publicly listed digital media companies performed in the first half of 2014. The group’s collective revenues topped $85.9 billion, a 17% YoY increase. Google led the pack with $31.4 million in sales. Online ads accounted for 77% of all digital media revenues, trailed by online games (15%) and video (5%). TechCrunch has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00YWqA000fPGA0j040D2L> . 

Hispanic Early Adopters 

Data from Verizon suggests Hispanic audiences are 72% more likely than non-Hispanic audiences to consume video online and via mobile. The study also finds that the average Hispanic viewer watches 90 minutes more online video per month than the average viewer. “This significantly reflects the media patterns of the young Hispanic generation, in particular Millennials, as they are prone to lead the way in consuming much of their media online,” says Daisy Terrazas-Cole, multicultural strategist at Haworth Marketing + Media. These patterns are in line with Hispanics’ early adoption of mobile technology and their tendency to highly consume media across the board.

Spree And Pray 

Yahoo might be shopping around for programmatic tech this holiday season, reports The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Shields. According to ad buyers, Yahoo may aspire to catch Google, Facebook and AOL as advertising moves more swiftly towards automation. Shields speculates that Yahoo’s plan of attack could involve video, on the coattails of its BrightRoll acquisition. Rather than buy one of the remaining large DSPs or SSPs, Shields writes, “Yahoo could go bold and buy one or several emerging players in this programmatic TV cluster, and get its hooks into a market that is certain to grow and has the potential to explode over the next few years.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0fmA0000q0D020LAWH> . The WSJ also chimes in with ESPN’s programmatic efforts. More here (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWH4fA00nL0PB012> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Deepest Darkest Social 

Alexis Madrigal, who coined the term “dark social” in reference to untraceable web traffic on social sites, issued an update on the phenomenon in a piece for Fusion <http://go.adexchanger.com/T40WD0P0f000DBM20L4qAA0> . According to data from Chartbeat, Madrigal says most of that traffic is percolating from Facebook’s mobile apps. “The takeaway is this: if you’re a media company, you are almost certainly underestimating your Facebook traffic,” Madrigal writes. “The only question is how much Facebook traffic you’re not counting. The bad news is that, if you didn’t know before, it should be even more clear now: Facebook owns web media distribution.” Gigaom has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0DWD0L5000B4000fN> . 

Programmatic It Girl 

The Association of National Advertisers (ANA) polled 349 of its members and declared “programmatic” the marketing word of 2014. Still, more than half of the marketers surveyed in a May ANA/Forrester white paper, titled “Media Buying’s Evolution Challenges Marketers,” confessed a lingering confusion about programmatic buying and a hesitancy to use automation to buy and manage campaigns. “This realistic self-appraisal opens the door for continued training and education,” the ANA said in a statement. Get the PDF <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0f60B4L0O2AAP00q0DD00>  (download). 

Crystal Clear 

And yet, confusion over programmatic isn’t slowing brand advertisers’ sashay into automation, AOL Platforms CEO Bob Lord told Ad Age in a video interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00P7DDA40LfB00PA>  on Friday. "We're starting to see a faster shift to programmatic advertising than we ever have before because there's a knowledge base within the brand advertiser of what the benefits can be,” Lord said. He added that AOL Platforms’ programmatic advertising business grew from 4% to almost 37% YoY, which he attributed “to the knowledge base of our brand advertisers.” 

Viewability Fallout 

Google’s new findings on viewable impressions could contribute to the delay of some ad tech IPOs, Collective CEO Joe Apprendi tells Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0P8B00000AD4Dq02fWQ0> . Google’s data suggest 56% of display ads aren’t viewable across Google and DoubleClick, and Apprendi says tech companies are better off as private entities when the industry makes a bigger push for full disclosure on the inventory it serves and the truth about who’s seeing it. “Do I want to be a public company while that happens? No," Apprendi says. "A year ago [headlines about transparency were] not even top of mind. Now it's a consideration." Read AdExchanger’s coverage of Google’s benchmark report <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0f90B4L0R2AAP00q0DD00> . 

Privatizing TV 

IPG’s Magna Global tapped Cox Media <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPfS0Dq0AD00B4a020W0>  and AudienceXpress to support a new web interface for TV ad buying, reports WSJ's Mike Shields. "Magna will be able to buy linear TV ads that would run within Cox Media’s local cable ad space. Magna will also be able to target specific audience segments for its clients via the new marketplace." The companies are calling the offering a private marketplace for television ads. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02T000bD00fPW04DABAqL0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Agency Shops Commerce 

Interpublic’s MRM//McCann snatched up Optaros on Thursday for an undisclosed sum, The Wall Street Journal  <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqSP04A0LB0WAz02f0000ED> reports. Optaros helps clients like Macy’s, Nestle and Rue La La build and manage ecommerce offerings. “We see a pretty dynamic marketplace in terms of what’s going on in the ecommerce business,” said MRM/McCann CEO Michael McLaren, adding that’s particularly true in mobile. “Many clients are getting into the business for the first time.” 

Publicis Checks In 

Publicis Groupe outlined 2018 objectives that focus on integrating new tech into business practices. “We are experiencing radical changes in consumer behavior and truly overturned business models under the impulse of digital,” said chief Maurice Lévy. “The speed of innovation and the leakage of digital in every economic sector are driving us to reposition Publicis Groupe in order to be able to bring our clients a radically new model, of delivering all of the services they need.” For Publicis’ warplan, read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0z0P4qA02000WLF0T0AfDB> . 

Facebook CMP Jolt 

Facebook CPMs are up 700% year over year, according to Kenshoo. “Not only has the Facebook ecosystem shifted but so have marketers’ approaches and programmes to reflect the changing environment,” said the firm’s marketing research analyst, Laura Ruszkowski. “By driving efficiencies and optimisations in their paid social programmes, marketers have become more sophisticated and their strategies more vigorous, thus increasing overall competition within Facebook advertising and, in turn, upping the worth of Facebook users.” Advertisers: get ready to spend! The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0GzfWPU0A00> . 

Diagnosing Yahoo 

Yahoo is in a position to surpass Twitter’s mobile ad share by 2015, according to eMarketer. But the long-term outlook for Yahoo is a bit darker, writes analyst Martin Utreras. “Yahoo’s growth in mobile is a very positive development for them as they try to play catch-up, but these revenues are growing from a small base, and Yahoo’s overall ad business is still struggling,” Utreras says. “They’ve trailed their competitors while taking a long time to monetize mobile, and these revenues are still muted in relation to the size of their mobile audience.” BrightRoll to the rescue? Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0Hz0Lf0DB0V0W0q4P20A0A> . 

Geo Trends 

Mindshare and Google surfaced a trend-tracking tool with geomarketing implications. "If you're Kleenex, it's the ability to understand there's a flu outbreak expected somewhere locally,” Mindshare Chief Digital Officer Norm Johnston told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0zWD0LW000B4000fI> . “If it's related to a variability in babies about to be born, it enables us to shift media spend related to Huggies. If there are nuances in particular features people are looking for in luxury cars, we can adapt the creative messaging with that particular audience.” No money changed hands between Mindshare and Google.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Accenture Nabs Agency 

Accenture will buy Australian agency Reactive Media as it continues to bone up on digital marketing. “Brands are recognizing that being relevant to customers has never depended more on how they engage with customers digitally,” said Brian Whipple, senior managing director for Accenture Interactive. The deal calls to mind Deloitte’s 2013 acquisition <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0f00wqFu>  of Seattle agency Banyan Branch. Agencies and consultants, unite! Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0fAAG0Dvw00> . 

Buying ‘Real-Time Content’ 

In another agency M&A move, WPP’s digital agency Possible snapped up Portland, Ore.-based Swift for an undisclosed sum. “Real-time content is what clients are asking for and what we predict is going to be an even bigger deal in years to come,” Possible CEO Shane Atchison  <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lww2HADP0f00A0> told The Wall Street Journal. “When you look at a digital agency’s relationship with a brand or client, content and social are the battleground.” The buy follows Possible’s August acquisition of app specialist Double Encore. Pair with this AdExchanger story <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PIB00000Aw4Dq02fWx0>  on how Possible and sister agency Mindshare mix media and creative. 

Native Automotive 

Hearst’s Jumpstart Automotive Group will license Nativo’s native ad delivery tech. Beginning in January, Jumpstart with adopt Nativo’s platform to serve native spots across its owned and operated sites, like Car & Driver, CarSoup.com and US New and World Report Automotive, which together reach over 25 million users. Nativo’s platform is compatible with programmatic systems, and Nativo SVP for Strategy and Operations Chris Rooke believes “more ad networks and ad providers that have worked with publishers on monetization will begin thinking about using this kind of technology to automate, streamline and scale their native ad products.” MediaPost has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PJByD000qA2w04L0f> . 

Stolen By Streaming 

Nielsen suggests TV viewership is waning as more eyeballs migrate to streaming services. It reported traditional TV viewership dipped 4% last quarter, while online video streaming spiked 60%. But Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos doesn’t see it that way. “We have seen Netflix viewing seed ratings improvements for shows from ‘Breaking Bad’ to ‘Curious George,’” Sarandos said. “Given the new license-fee revenue from Netflix and other [subscription video-on-demand] players, and the relatively stable upfront ad dollars, share may be shifting but the pie appears to have grown.” Read on via The WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLwWz0APfK020qD40> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

App Install Ads, Now In Video 

Facebook added some features to help developers manage and promote their apps. There are three core changes: Facebook is extending autoplay video to its mobile app install ad units, supporting reach and frequency targeting for those formats in mobile and adding support for Amazon Fire tablets. “With more and more people uploading, sharing and discovering videos on Facebook, marketers are finding video to be an important asset to drive key business metrics,” the company said in a post on its developer blog. But marketers will have to be “eligible” for autoplay videos. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0HrfWPN0A00> . Related reading: TechCrunch’s Josh Constine on the rise of the app install ad <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00rA0L0DI00fB2qW0AOP04> . 

AppNexus Reorg 

A reorg at AppNexus creates four new units to keep up with the evolving programmatic ecosystem, MediaPost reports. Those divisions will focus on publishers, programmatic media companies, agencies and advertisers and marketplaces. “We’re creating companies within the company, essentially,” AppNexus President Michael Rubenstein told Real-Time Daily. The reorg has already begun, Rubenstein added, and is expected to finalize by the end of the year. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/gJ0D40L0q20fBA0AW000PrP>  

Viewer Rewards 

Viggle and HGTV paired up to lift audience engagement with HGTV programming by rewarding viewers for watching certain shows. The companies are incentivizing HGTV viewers with points and rewards when fans engage with HGTV content by “checking in” with shows on Viggle’s apps. The companies are clear about what they’ll do with that data: “HGTV will leverage check-in data to gain insights around viewing behavior and engagement.” Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPfK4B00W000qAr0020AQD> . 

Inventory Everywhere 

In a similar pairing, BlackArrow and Virgin Media joined forces to up engagement on Virgin Media’s on-demand TV platform and Virgin TV Anywhere. The partnership extends BlackArrow’s tech to Virgin’s streaming systems, and includes features common to ad servers, such as frequency capping, real-time performance metrics and audience segmentation, which will improve yield, according to BlackArrow President Nick Troiano. “The use of on-demand inventory for precise audience targeting will deliver more effective and measurable results,” he said. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/TR0Wr0P0f000DBL20L4qAA0> . 

Tapping Into Data Accuracy 

Tapad wants you to know that it’s not just another probabilistic cross-device provider. The company, whose technology uses a core of deterministic data to build out statistical cross-device matches, announced that Nielsen has verified <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWr4fA00SL0PB0M2>  its data – to the tune of 91.2% accuracy. It’s a healthy number, considering cross-device recognition methods are still in their relative infancy. Experts with whom AdExchanger spoke <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PTDrA40LfB00NA>  previously estimated cross-device accuracy rates as low as 50% or 75%. In other news, Tapad said Tuesday that it’s received certification from the Network Advertising Initiative, a self-regulatory association focused on responsible data collection.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

AOL’s Video Spree 

AOL is growing its video empire and on Monday snapped up Vidible for an estimated $50 million, Re/code reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0mA0DB0WT2Lq00fA00U4P0> . Vidible is a video management and exchange platform that works with 150 publishers, and the company claims to generate more than 2 billion video views per month. The buy stacks Vidible on top of AOL’s Adapt.tv buy in 2013 and its acquisition of 5Min in 2010.  Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBV000Amf0A200WL4qPU00> . And read AdExchanger’s recent coverage of Vidible’s anti-fraud solution <http://go.adexchanger.com/FfDBL00VW0W0P2mq000AA04> . 

Vox Raises 

Some of Vox Media’s’ fresh $46.5 million round, led by General Atlantic, will support an ad tech buildout. “Our Hymnal platform, which is our ad platform, that's another way to work with publishers as well as advertisers,” CEO Jim Bankoff tells AdAge. “[Vox's ad formats] are built to be extensible beyond our sites.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0fqW0D00XAWB0m4PA>  Re/code reports that Vox’s total valuation now comes to $380 million, less than half that of BuzzFeed. “Our investors and our board see a lot of opportunity, and they want us to invest in new things. But they wouldn’t do that if they didn’t think the business is working,” Bankoff added. Read that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02X000Ym00fPW04DABAqL0>  

Curbing The Social Data 

A report from the UK’s Commons Science and Technology Select Committee urges social media companies to simplify their terms and conditions. Chairman Andrew Miller said Facebook’s recently updated privacy policy <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0m0P4qA02000WLY0Z0AfDB>  "highlighted serious concerns about the extent to which ticking the 'terms and conditions' box can be said to constitute informed consent when it comes to the varied ways data is now being used by many websites and apps.” This comes in the wake of Twitter’s blog pos <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00P0DmA40LfB00ZA> t clarifying its data collection policies. The BBC has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPf04B00W000qAn0020A2D> . 

Mobile Commerce Swell 

Based on its online commerce data, PayPal reports that this year’s volume of holiday purchases broke the record for consumers shopping on mobile. On Thanksgiving, the company saw a 47% YoY increase in global mobile payments, and on Black Friday that jumped to 62%. TechCrunch’s Sarah Perez notes <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00f01n0W3DP0L0A00>  that PayPal rakes in $1 for every $6 worth of ecommerce exchanges it facilitates, “which puts it in a unique position to analyze shopping data and draw insights.” 

Adslot Links Up With Operative 

Programmatic direct promises to eliminate IOs. Adslot, a player in the programmatic-direct space, signed a global partnership with another paperwork eliminator, Operative. The workflow automation company simplifies billing and ad trafficking for publishers. With the partnership, publishers can do deals with Adslot’s agency buyers within Operative’s platform, giving the programmatic-direct player a foothold among Operative’s users.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Twitter’s Nice List 

On the very quiet Wednesday before Thanksgiving, Twitter told users it would start collecting data on external apps installed on their phones. In its own words <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LjV2TADP0f00A0> , “We are collecting and occasionally updating the list of apps installed on your mobile device so we can deliver tailored content that you might be interested in.” Twitter says it will use the data to improve suggestions on who to follow, inform which Tweets it plugs into a user’s timeline and display “more relevant promoted content.” The app is the pixel. More via Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWW400U0ABD00j0fL02P0Aq> . 

Programmatic Fashion 

Haute couture retailer Burberry is making a programmatic push with a tie-up to Yahoo and Dentsu Aegis. Burberry’s campaign, launched last week, was a daylong takeover of Yahoo’s home page in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. “All of our inventory, including our most premium formats, is now available programmatically, offering brands the chance to run fully programmatic campaigns cross-market,” said Yahoo EMEA’s VP of audience network and programmatic platforms, Nick Huge. The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/ljBqV000LfDP0A2A4000X0W> . 

Tumbling Into View 

Research from the Global Web Index <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0f0YWD0L4PW0A2q0j0BA00>  claims that Tumblr has surpassed Instagram as the fastest-growing social platform. “Facebook has some major challenges to face,” writes the report’s author, Jason Mander. “Firstly, people are growing tired of it, with 50% of members in the UK and US saying that they’re using it less frequently than they used to (rising to 64% among teens). Since the start of 2013, we’ve seen behaviors like sharing photos and messaging friends fall by around 20 percentage points.” Coupled with Tumblr’s recently released mobile ad  <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00jZ0ALAWPXfB02q000> product, user growth could help the platform attract advertisers. 

Global Forgetfulness 

The EU’s list of Google grievances grows. Last week, EU privacy chiefs were gunning to make Google apply the Right To Be Forgotten ruling beyond the European Union. The freshly drafted set of rules are not yet legally binding, but ask that Google adopt “forgotten” rules to search queries in the US. More via Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0f00WD0L4PZ0A2q0k0BA00> . Related: Europe’s Right To Be Forgotten is not only about Google. Bing and Yahoo have begun obliterating links at the request of European users. Read that <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00P0DkA40LfB001A> . 

Mozilla Stumped 

In a TechCrunch post considering Mozilla’s fortunes, Frederic Lardinois concludes the once-powerful nonprofit is in trouble as its desktop browser loses share and its mobile OS efforts fail to bear fruit. “Over the last few years, Mozilla tried to make up ground by launching its own platform. That was an audacious effort … to bring low-cost phones to developing countries — but so far, that effort has barely paid off except for in a couple of very small markets.” Mozilla’s ability to dictate privacy-centric ad policies across the web could fade along with its influence.
