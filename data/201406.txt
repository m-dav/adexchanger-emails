 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

CRMing The Exchange

On Friday, Rubicon Project and CRM agency Merkle announced a new capability within programmatic ad buying and selling. The development rolls together Rubicon Project's Advertising Automation Cloud and Merkle's suite of marketing tools, and claims to help advertisers run campaigns that achieve 100% of share-of-voice on any given page. The development couples together branding media and ad automation technology, explained client Business Insider’s COO, Julie Hansen, in the release. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/AT0504WB200A4Pq00L0I0DA> .

Traditional Hacking

Comcast’s NBCUniversal Media Labs announced results of its first hackathon. [record scratch] Hackathon at “the peacock?”  Times are changing.  Multichannel News reports, “The event was organized by AngelHack and brought together about 150 people. They formed about 23 teams that created 26 prototypes designed to address business and technology challenges developed by various NBCUniversal and Comcast division[s].” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/B4006W2A000040TB0DJLPqA> .

Going Up

In an interview with eMarketer, 360i group media director Jessica Sanfilippo sees data driving CPMs and says, “Audience data is definitely ... driving prices up. We’ll see CPM upticks as much as three times the amount of the base media. So in some cases, the data is being valued at higher levels than the media itself – that has a pretty profound effect on CPMs.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0400Tq7K> .

May Mobile App Install Data

On Friday, Fiksu released May's data for app install costs. The index helps mobile marketers navigate the space based on measurable metrics. The App Store Competitive Index increased 24% month over month, reaching 6.6 million over April's 5.34 million. Year over year, the index increased 12%. Marketers are looking to lock in user loyalty, leading to a rise in the cost per loyal user in May's index. Access the data at Fiksu <http://go.adexchanger.com/jq8B042LW004D0P0AAL0T00> .

Automating The Home Page

Home page takeover has long been one of advertisers' most powerful and premium ploys. The home page takeover strategy offers marketers a chance to commandeer publishers’ home pages for a limited time. Now, some of the top publishers are moving to take the home page takeover offering into programmatic channels, says The Wall Street Journal’s Suzanne Vranica. Time Inc., Hearst Corp. and Business Insider are already on board. Read more (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW09L0000TP02BAqD40M40A> .

Swarming The Data

Foursquare will start charging developers for access to its location data, the company announced Friday. The decision could affect marketing apps that rely on Foursquare's map data, such as Google, AggData, Navteq and Open Street Map. Tens of thousands of developers access the tech company’s network daily, but Foursquare says it will only charge those that pass a certain data usage threshold. Originally a free app that spun off its check-in function into the standalone app Swarm, Foursquare's move might help the company monetize its offerings.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Marketer Roundup

Estee Lauder, L’Oreal and Spark marketing executives weigh in on programmatic in a recent roundup feature via Portada. "We find programmatic buying an efficient use of our dollars to reach consumers who are already engaged with the concept, the brand and the products, (and) we are using it globally," said Estée Lauder marketing manager Marlene Moronta. However, she cautions that "while it is effective, it is really about engaging the user through other methods and creating an experience that she can be part of, both online and off." Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0480B4L0T2AAP00q0DL00> ..

Trader Monogamy

WPP Group CEO Martin Sorrell said the trend of marketers taking programmatic in-house is challenged by the unwillingness of smart traders to focus on a single client. “I don't think programmatic buying in one client will be successful because I don't think that good people will want to work in something like an in-house agency. They want variety. Our people want different challenges.” More in the Drum. <http://go.adexchanger.com/m000092040qA4LPDBLU0WA0>  Pair with AdExchanger’s feature on this topic. <http://go.adexchanger.com/I040VWD0L4Pa0A2q0L0BA00> 

Facebook Retargeting Evolution

Facebook has added more segmentation to its retargeting engine, letting advertisers bucket their website visitors into groups such as lapsed visitors. Additionally advertisers can now advertise multiple products within a horizontally scrolling unit. “Combining the multi-product ad unit with Custom Audiences from your website, you can produce a carousel of different items – like handbags, sundresses and sandals – to show in News Feed to specific audiences,” Facebook said in a blog post. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0WL0L40DB0b0W0q4P20A0A> 

Publicis’ Roar

Publicis Groupe on Thursday launched ROAR, a full-service digital agency. The new agency rolls together team members from across Publicis for its executive leadership. Sean Reardon will serve as the agency's president, reporting to both Rishad Tobaccowala, chief strategy and innovation officer at VivaKi, and Tim Jones, ZenithOptimedia chairman and CEO.

Industry Allies In Ukraine

TubeMogul co-founder and CEO Brett Wilson writes for Re/code to rally the tech community in support of industry allies in Ukraine. The country, particularly Kiev, risks suffering a massive brain drain. Wilson encourages all to donate to nonprofit organizations like Brain Basket Foundation <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D4BqA0020P0WYALd00>  or Tech4Ukraine <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0Z4A00eLD0AP00040> . Tech4Ukraine was launched just this week by 10 member companies, including TubeMogul. Wilson explains, "Tech4Ukraine’s mission is nonpolitical: We aim to raise global support and awareness for Ukraine’s information technology industry. We aren’t unrealistic – our efforts won’t stop the conflict – but hopefully we can at least show solidarity with Ukrainian technology professionals and raise some money to foster their growth."

Sagacity For Sellers

Doug Weaver shares four touchpoints on how best to motivate and engage your sales team for the balance of 2014 and beyond in his latest installment of The Drift. Educating sellers on agency business is the first step, according to Weaver. Also crucial is encouraging seller-client relationships, abandoning compensation plans and fostering dialogue between management and staff.

Krafty Motion Ads

Yahoo claims its Motion Ads lead to higher sales and increased positive brand association, Adweek reported Thursday. One of the first brands to sign up for Motion Ads was Kraft, and the company launched a capping on March 17 showcasing a steaming grilled cheese. Yahoo reported that audiences that viewed the ad were 77% more likely to use the keyword Kraft in a search, and the Motion Ad had a 24% higher click rate than a standard video ad on a login page. Maybe the Kraft campaign wasn't so cheesy after all. Read more via Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqjB042LW004D0P0AA30M00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Amazon Chases App Supply

Amazon is looking to incentivize developers with the promise of a guaranteed $6 CPM on interstitial ads for mobile in August and September. The ads are full-screen, typically appearing between game levels and will be served across Android phones and tablets, Kindle Fire tablets and Fire phones. Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00GA0L0DB004B2qW0ALP04> .

Aereo No More

Reports of TV’s death have been greatly exaggerated (again). "Today’s decision by the United States Supreme Court is a massive setback for the American consumer," said Aereo founder Chet Kanojia in a statement. Bloomberg's Joshua Brustein writes, "The online video trend hasn’t undermined the incredibly lucrative television advertising business yet, but it seems inevitable it will do so in the future. As a result, existing broadcast and cable companies are only tentatively exploring Internet video." Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW04M0B4L0C2AAP00q0DG00> .

MoPub Mediates

Twitter's MoPub exchange now offers mediation between native ad networks for mobile publishers, in a further proof point that native and programmatic are compatible. “Our platform… maximizes your native ad revenue by automatically selecting the ad source that offers the best CPM — whether that’s one of your native ad networks, an advertiser on MoPub Marketplace <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LGD2NADP0400A0> , or one of your direct-sold partners.” Read the blog post. <http://go.adexchanger.com/gE0D40L0q204BA0AW000OGP> 

Linking Sales To Mobile Ads

SessionM aims to measure the sales impact of mobile ads by leveraging Datalogix's consumer behavior on mobile devices. "The last piece in mobile has always been how do brands bridge that gap from targeted ad experience to closing the loop on a purchase," explained SessionM CRO Bill Clifford. "We are onboarding offline shopping data into the network to enable targeting based on a actual purchase behavior." Adweek has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PPB00000AG4Dq024WF0> .

Yahoo Viewable Guarantee

Yahoo joins the ad viewability fray with its latest offering, Prime View. Some marketers are only charged if a promotion is viewed. Google introduced similar capabilities <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4G0Q0P00qD002LBW0GA4>  two years ago, but Yahoo claims it's the largest publisher to do so. "This will allow marketers to better understand the effectiveness of their online advertising and return on investment from their campaigns,” said David Gunzerath, SVP and associate director at MRC.

Party Planning For Marketers

Marketo will integrate Cvent’s event management platform into its marketing automation toolset. Called the Marketo LaunchPoint ecosystem, the offering aims to make event planning more efficient for marketers seeking brand awareness. "In-person events are typically 25% of an organization’s marketing budget,” explained Cvent Marketing VP Eric Eden. “So marketers need event management technology that is linked to their marketing systems to convert event leads to sales."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Weeding Out Bots, Funds

Researchers at security startup White Ops claim they've found a way to weed out bot traffic from online human behavior for good, and the eight-month-old company has the financial backing to prove it. New investors, including Paladin Capital Group and Grotech Ventures, have already pumped a combined $7 million into the company. White Ops sells a line of code to its customers that lets clients determine the volume of bot traffic on their sites. White Ops co-founder Dan Kaminsky said, “In the beginning, advertisers were saying, ‘We’re afraid to do something,’ because fraud was generating so much revenue for the display ad industry.” He continued, “Now the fraud is large enough that they’re saying, ‘We’re afraid not to do something.’" The NY Times has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PJDAA40L4B00FA> .

Taboola Scores

Content discovery platform Taboola announced on Tuesday an exclusive, multiyear partnership with NBC Sports Digital. NBC Sports Digital will display Taboola's personalized content recommendations across 16 of its websites with the goal of increasing page views and generating revenue. Taboola says its technology uses an algorithm to examine user context, browsing history, geographic location and social media trends, and it serves more than 130 billion content recommendations monthly.

Targeting The Nest

Nest <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B04AAL0DHA00>  is sharing user data with its parent company, Google, for the first time since it was acquired in February, and the move is raising questions about privacy. The majority of the data the smart thermostat company plans to share centers on whether users are home or not, and Nest says it plans to allow other developers of household appliances access to user data. According to Matt Rogers, a Nest co-founder, "We’re not telling Google anything that it doesn’t already know."

The Programmatic TV Debate

Programmatic buying for television is still in its infancy, and the jury's hung on whether the broadcast networks will adapt. Adweek staff writers Sam Thielman and Garett Sloane square off to argue opposing sides of the debate. Thielman says no, largely because programmatic ad buying for television lacks a definitive definition. But Sloane points out that a growing number of media providers such as Cox Media and Clypt are opening their inventory to demand-side tech providers like Google, Turn and TubeMogul.

Pay As You App

US mobile carrier FreedomPop is planning a "pay as you app" feature that offers free mobile data plans by downloading sponsored apps. Meanwhile, the apps’ ads will be offered to marketers programmatically, with advertisers choosing particular time segments, geolocations and age demographics for targeting. "We are investing a lot to build out the capability for any app developer or company to sponsor data with pricing determined by an app’s approximate data consumption," says one FreedomPop source. The company services a quarter million subscribers (Verizon has 124 million subscribers), but FreedomPop says its users are growing at a rate of 20% month on month.

Nouvelle Mobile

Le Monde is breaking the banner ad mold for mobile. As the French publisher debuts its new smartphone app, the company will roll out four new mobile ad formats. The Slider is one new format, first used by Sony Mobile and Land Rover, that integrates ads into editorial content (native much?). “In France, the advertising market is not very well developed on mobile,” said Isabelle André, CEO of Le Monde Interactif, the department that oversees the newspaper’s digital activities. “We wanted this market to move to something else, because everyone wants to buy a splash [ad]. The splash screen is a very good format, but it’s only one. And advertisers don’t create very beautiful ads for banners." Digiday has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B04AAQ0DMA00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Ad-Supported Episodes

Amazon is experimenting with ad-supported TV, TechCrunch reported Monday. The Amazon Instant Video app on iOS now offers HBO content for free, and the company will support select episodes with ads. This free content feature is already available on Kindle Fire, as well as on Roku, but Amazon denied plans to launch a fully ad-supported free media service.

Automating TV Ads

In a feature for Broadcasting & Cable, contributing editor George Winslow unpacks the challenges to programmatic advertising as it relates to traditional TV marketing. "Using massive databases, complex algorithms and advanced advertising capabilities first developed for the online world, programmatic buying systems promise to greatly streamline the buying and selling of inventory first for TV programming on digital platforms, and ultimately on linear TV as well," writes Winslow. However! "Much work remains to be done in terms of standards, reducing latency for ad insertion, changing long established workflows, data management systems and improved measurement."

Hacking The Recommendation

The infiltration used New York-based content recommendation platform Taboola by injecting a redirect code into Taboola's widget on Reuters.com. Read on at Network World <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000r2W40L0B0RA4PDAq> . As Rob Leathern tweeted <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4r0S0P00qD002LBW0XA4> , “This will not be the last ad tech hack of a big pub.”

Facebook’s New Video Metrics

Facebook announced on Monday an improvement to how the company will rank videos people and pages upload directly to the social media platform. Facebook's goal is to understand what content is most popular, so that only relevant videos appear in the news feed. Factors for determining video relevancy include time spent watching videos, numbers of likes, comments and shares. Early tests showed that audiences grew around relevant video content. Page owners can access the new video metrics <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D4BqA0020P0WYArT00>  section in FB's Page Insights to clarify how audiences are reacting to their uploaded videos.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Native Yahoo

Yahoo’s digital magazines and, consequently, native advertising strategy are under review in a Sunday NY Times article. Nothing too earth-shattering is learned about Yahoo ads and its new Tumblr solutions other than the usual: The banner is dead (or in decline) at Yahoo; native formats have a better (10x higher) CTR than standard display; there is no mention of brand lift or awareness metrics; and the ability for Yahoo to scale native is unclear. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/jq3B042LW004D0P0AAe0l00> . Yahoo – and the industry as a whole – needs data-driven proof native works beyond the click, and at scale. In Yahoo speak, bringing more science to the “native” art might be a great opportunity to differentiate.

Searching For Yield

German news sites are attempting to extract an “11% fee” from Google for aggregating links to its articles. Industry pundit Jeff Jarvis takes a look and begins, “[The German publishers’] demands are as absurd as they are cynical and dangerous. First, of course, Google is sending the publishers plenty of value as well. That is, Google is sending the publishers us: readers, customers, the public these news organizations allegedly want to serve. So what are we, chopped liver?” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0P4BfD000qA2l04L04> . And Danny Sullivan offers his thoughts here <http://go.adexchanger.com/jq5B042LW004D0P0AAg0l00> .

Super RTM

Building on their programmatic partnership, AOL and agency Universal McCann (UM) say they are rethinking how to serve ads, and their plan claims to take a macro approach to real-time marketing. "Rather than relying on traditional planning paradigms, where we're hoping to take advantage of time frame or predictions in the market, we're actually reacting in real-time and then we have creative set up to run against that," said UM COO Gregg Colvin. This is in line with how The Weather Company serves ads, but the trigger data will come from sports scores, market indices, local gas piracies and life events like birthdays and anniversaries, among others.

Offline-Online Data

Beacons and Wi-Fi-sensing technology may be working to track in-store behaviors, but new tech could take targeting to the next level. Perch Interactive is one company coupling sensing technology with projectors to track and log in-store consumer behavior, and is trialing the tech in NY Kate Spade stores. "We equate this to browser cookies in the real world,” said IPG Media Lab’s Jack Pollock. “We can now record if someone’s interacted or picked up a product off the shelf; time spent with that product; all of these metrics that we have online, brought offline.” Marketers could leverage the data for tailor-made messages based on consumer-product interactions.

Adding To Ecommerce

OwnerIQ, which helps retailers and manufactures monetize their online customers, even when ecommerce browsers don't purchase a thing, has completed an $11 million round of funding, according to a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0lA0DB0Wk2Lq004A0094P0>  Friday, and said it plans to grow its revenue by 70% this year. In addition to owning product-oriented community websites, OwnerIQ has an ad tech platform that lets manufacturers and retailers exchange first-party data for the purpose of targeted digital advertising. “Audience monetization is incremental revenue for e-commerce players," Fortune’s Erin Griffith reports. "A retailer selling $100 million worth of products might make $10 million in profit. They’re already paying to attract the audience, so if they sell $10 million worth of media (in addition to selling products), they make [an additional] $10 million in profit." HookLogic and Bazaarvoice also get a mention. Read more via Fortune <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0la02q0L0AB0D400Al4> .

Findings show that 35% of back-to-school shoppers buy online, with 69% of shoppers planning to spend the same in 2014 as they did in 2013 (while 19% say they'll spend more and 5% will spend less).

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google Gobbles Up mDialog

Google acquired mDialog <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40D0A2d0BkLD0W4P00q0A0> , signaling its interest in more digital advertising. mDialog is a small-fish tech provider in the digital video ad space that services some major media companies and broadcasters. In a Google <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqlB042LW004D0P0AAE0d00> + post concerning the acquisition, Google says, “We’re committed to offering more ways for publishers to monetize live, linear and on-demand video content across all screens. While nothing’s changing for their customers immediately, over time we’ll work with the mDialog team to incorporate their technology and expertise into our DoubleClick product suite.” The deal closed for an undisclosed sum.

Ad Tech Nonprofit

A coalition of 20 ad tech companions, which include Rubicon, OpenX, Dstillery and Casale Media, are forming a nonprofit that seeks to simplify programmatic ad buying. DigiTrust <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqnB042LW004D0P0AAG0d00>  will create a standard ID for Web visitors rather than allow individual companies to use their own ID. If the industry adopts the DigiTrust ID, publishers' sites could load faster due to a reduction in tags on their pages, ad tech companies could share information more simply and a new set of privacy controls could crop up. Rubicon VP of Product Jordan Mitchell will serve as chairman and interim CEO of DigiTrust. Ad Age has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DHA02000BWd0q44oLP0A> . And read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02I000pd004PW04DABAqL0> .

Holding Hands For Pre-Roll

Cross-device ad platform provider Drawbridge announced new capabilities on Thursday that give its advertisers access to a supply of premium pre-roll video inventory via Drawbridge's integration with LiveRail. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0400dqqJ> . Meanwhile, Datonics became a VivaKi Verified partner on Wednesday. The alliance marks a data partnership that extends Datonics' data to VivaKi's programmatic media solution, Audience On Demand. The alliance will "provide VivaKi advertisers with access to (Datonics') search, purchase-intent and life-stage data segments," according to CEO Michael Benedek, "as well as an unlimited number of custom keyword-derived segments."

Amazon’s Phone Under Fire

Amazon’s new Fire phone may not be an easy sell, the NYT reports, due to a high price point and an obligatory two-year AT&T contract. Yet an interesting new image recognition feature will help Fire owners snap a picture of any item and be directed to Amazon's site for purchase. "Helping people take care of their shopping tasks is an important job to do in any smartphone,” said Amazon CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos. “But that’s not what the phone is all about," he added, calling that notion "too simplistic." What, no ads? Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0Ls02q0L0AB0D400Ad4> .

Mobile… WTF?

“All programmatic means is automation, so we’re not getting into any less of a complex role,” said Twitter head of marketplace development Paul Gelb during Neo@Ogilvy’s “Mobile... WTF?” conference on Thursday. Speaking on automation during a panel titled “Does Device Matter,” Gelb continued, “Your users are changing, their behavior is changing, but you have the opportunity and the ability to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time. If you’re not doing it, someone else will. There are going to be winners and losers. I think the people who are approaching programmatic intelligently are asking how do we address complexity overall? How do we define the core benchmarks that we want to deliver and make that more addressable?”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 
Targeting Wearables


Tech startup Appier raised $6 million, TechCrunch reported Wednesday. Appier offers targeted marketing across wearables, smartphones and tablets, and works with clients such as Heineken, IKEA, Lancome and game developers. Appier will use the funding to further research its cross-screen targeting platform. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00L2i2OADP0400A0> . Looking forward to the programmatic wearable? The Appier site touts <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PPD2A40L4B00jA>  real-time bidding tech.


Outbrained


Content marketing ad network Outbrain has run afoul of the ad watchdog Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK. Marketing Week reports the ASA “ruled that that the (Outbrain) ad was misleading because it did not make it clear enough that it was a marketing communication. The ASA has told Outbrain to ensure any future advertising was clearly identifiable.” See an example and read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/l2BqQ000L4DP0A2A4000k0W> .


Fighting Video Fraud


SpotXchange and DoubleVerify announced a partnership on Wednesday that aims to combat video fraud by eliminating non-human traffic. With the addition of DoubleVerify's brand performance insights, SpotXchange now has the tools to block bot impressions. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWl400R0ABD00204L02P0Aq> .


TV Turn


In a brief Q&A, CEO Bill Demas talked to The Wall Street Journal about programmatic TV, among other topics. Among the challenges to programmatic television, Demas says, “There needs to be actual supply. I think there have been recent developments in the space where there are now companies providing actual TV inventory via an exchange and some of that is brand new.” Read more (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02m000S2004PW04DABAqL0> .


End Of Days


Mixing the visage of Justin Bieber and with the future of programmatic, Upstream Group’s Doug Weaver looks at his crystal ball on his company’s blog and channels: “I predict that Programmatic specialists on both sides of the table will fade away; that more than 90% of all online ad transactions will be executed programmatically; that programmatic trading and buying will become vastly de-centralized; and that the word Programmatic itself will fall out of use.” Read more from the Weaver <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pn4020DTA4q2> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Buying Time Spent


Contently’s Sam Petulla interviews Jon Slade, digital ad director for the FT, on the FT’s new “time spent” currency being implemented instead of CPMs. He explains, “We’re working from a hypothesis that one hour is our currency, with a minimum of five seconds of exposure. So we could sell you 720 impressions at five seconds or other lengths of exposure, depending on the total time you would like. Our task during the summer is determining how to find and sell the five seconds of time to c-level executives the right way.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqfP04A0LB0WAW0230000QD> . Interesting take.


Tweeting Boosts TV Ads


Leveraging Twitter could increase the effectiveness of television ad campaigns, according to new research by Starcom MediaVest Group. The six-month study monitored paired TV and Twitter ads, and showed that Twitter-supported TV campaigns have a 50% greater ROI than TV-only campaigns. "When you run both TV and Twitter together, we actually think budgets can go from the digital side to TV,” Twitter's president of global revenue, Adam Bain, told Digiday in Cannes. “Spending on Twitter makes your digital outcomes go farther, but your TV outcomes go farther as well.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/igWW00B3PRL00A000Dq2A04> .

Walmart Labs acquired Stylr on Tuesday, in an effort to enhance the in-store mobile experience.

"Over half of Walmart smartphone users have used their device in-store to assist with their shopping," said Walmart Lab’s global head of mobile and digital, Gibu Thomas, in a Walmart Labs blog post, "With 80% of our customers under the age of 35 owning a smartphone, we expect this to grow dramatically."

Mapping Data


WPP-owned data facilitating company The Data Alliance struck a partnership on Tuesday with Factual. The agreement lets WPP operating companies access mapping data for more than 65 million businesses. GroupM, Kantar, JWT, Cohn & Wolfe and Wunderman, for example, can all now leverage Factual's data that maps known locations of mobile phones. The data will also be incorporated into WPP's programmatic platform, Xaxis. Xaxis Chairman David J. Moore said that Factual's data can increase Xaxis’s ability to provide relevant ads based on geography. Read the <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00UWqA0003PWA0j040D2L>  press release. And read AdExchanger 2013 interview with Factual <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWV400k0ABD00W03L02P0Aq> .

TV Clypd


Clypd, a company developed by the makers of mobile ad network WHERE (which PayPal acquired in 2011), says it has developed a system to better help automate the process of programmatic TV ad buys. Cox Media Group’s VP of biz dev, Mike Zeigler, told AdWeek that legacy spot-buying systems “are focused on scheduling 30-second spots in a traditional fashion, but now we can do it in a much more automated manner.” Clypd’s claim is that its new software API links digitally attuned systems such as Turn and DataXu to television providers like Cox.

Private Shift


Last week GroupM announced plans to yank its clients' budgets from open ad exchanges, Beet.TV first reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00WY0ALAWPn3B02q000> . Yesterday, Xaxis’ Brian Lesser walked it back a bit, according to Zach Rodgers in Cannes <http://go.adexchanger.com/T60WW0P03000DBH20L4qAA0> . Nevertheless, Ad Age reporter Tim Peterson asks the question: What does the proposed shift mean for the industry? The move draws a line in the sand between ad tech operators that have added private exchanges and those that have not, says Peterson. Google, AOL and Yahoo all operate both open and private exchanges and if the shift to private starts trending, ad tech intermediary companies might be edged out.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Biting Into Programmatic

Mondelez International is adopting a programmatic strategy for video buying through TubeMogul, according to a release. Working with brands like Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Toblerone and Trident, the CPG corporation will target consumers mainly through mobile and Internet videos. "Programmatic fits within the larger digital optimization strategy we’ve been employing for the last year as we shift more media spend to digital, and online video is a major area for growth," said Mondelez Associate Director for Global Media Ivelisse Roche tells Adweek. Mondelez already allocates about $200 million annually to global marketing, and 25% of that spend goes to digital advertising. Roche estimates that figure will grow to 50% by 2016, the majority of which will be devoted to video. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/F3DBL00rI0W0P2Oq000AA04> . And, read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B03AAJ0DsO00> .

Eyeing Automation

Research from Starcom MediaVest Group, which surveyed 120 UK media businesses, found that 62% of participants feel programmatic is crucial for future success. Yet 75% of those surveyed said agencies should aid in helping decomplexify programmatic strategizing. "The results … highlighted the significance of the consumer behaviour of mobility – driven by tech and that it is still considered as undervalued – the significant opportunity for the everyday partnership between clients, agencies and media owners is how we precisely deliver relevant content to the ever-growing mobile consumer,” said Starcom co-CEO Steve Parker. Read more via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0300OqKt> .

Partnering For Tech

The Exchange Lab announced on Monday a partnership with MediaMath to that will expand the company's client access to MediaMath's technology, The Drum reports. The Exchange Lab's Chris Dobson will graduate from his role as non-executive direct to his new appointment as executive chairman. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0uO3WPL0A00> .

AutoNavi Charging For Data

AutoNavi, a mapping company recently acquired by Alibaba, announced its monetization strategy at the World Geospatial Developers Conference last week in Beijing. The company will collect transaction-based commissions from the third-party organizations that use AutoNavi's data, in addition to introducing a data-trading platform service. This marks a pivot for Alibaba, as the e-commerce giant has not taken transaction-based commissions through its various market places until now. Previously, Alibaba relied on in-market advertising for monetization. VentureBeat has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0v3A00MOD0AP00040> .

Offline-Online Retargeting

SiteSout, which offers a self-serve platform for programmatic buying, announced a partnership with Aislelabs on Monday. Aislelab's platform helps retailers with mobile apps retarget in-store visitors on the Web. Through the partnership, retailers can tailor retargeting ads based on in-store consumer behavior for delivery across devices. "The concept of retargeting in-store visitors, once they are online, fills a gap in the market," said Aislelabs co-founder and CEO Nick Koudas. "We are moving towards a more holistic understanding of customer behavior, enabling retailers to finally close the loop and deliver more effective advertising.” Read the  <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWO43A00NL0PB0w2> press release.

Indexing Ads

In case you missed it last week, data from ad platform and publisher Owner IQ is being used to create something called the RTB 500. RTB in this case stands for real-time buying... not bidding. New York Times reporter Stuart Elliott describes it as an index that claims “to track in real time the movements in price for ads bought and sold on the websites of 500 publishers.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00OA0L0Dz003B2qW0AQP04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

What Cannes Means

WPP Group CEO Sir Martin Sorrell inserts himself in the pages of The Telegraph with a wide-ranging op-ed on what this week’s Cannes Lions ad festival <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0Z3A00aID0AP00040>  means to Europe. The festival now recognizes that “advertising is now as much about Math’s Men as Mad Men,” says Sorrell, adding, “The ethos is openness, internationalism and, above all, celebration. The judges, with the occasional exception, put aside national differences and professional conflicts to choose the very best work, whatever its origin.” On the other hand, the politics of Europe, he says, are in “stark contrast.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/AJ0c04WB200A3Pq00L000DA> .

Privatizing The Exchange

The Wall Street Journal reviews GroupM’s announcement that it won’t be buying through open exchanges in the near future. Industry execs weigh in and see the reasons for the move ranging from ad quality issues in the open exchanges to securing first look access to publisher inventory. Wayne Gattinella, CEO of DoubleVerify, offers his thoughts, “If nothing else, it’s definitely a loud and open challenge to the exchanges that they need to provide greater transparency into the quality of the ad impression they’re delivering.” Read more (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/q3AW0A0DLd004J02B0P100q> .

Local Reservation Data

On Friday, the Priceline Group acquired OpenTable in a cash transaction valued at $2.6 billion. The merger follows TripAdvisor's purchase of LaFourchette last month, a Paris-based startup which offers similar restaurant booking services. Developing mobile integrations will be a key strategy moving forward, said executives during the Priceline Group's investor's call on Friday morning. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W03eA0q020BAL0PDJ2> . In the end, it means heaps of local intent data for Priceline -- real-time and from the app, too. More analysis from PandoDaily <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00303J0WfDP0L0A00> .

Adobe Updates

Adobe unveiled new updates to its Digital Publishing Suite <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00JA0L0D4003B2qW0AgP04>  (DPS) on Friday. The enhancements include DPS integration with CRM integration (yes, integration times two), as well as tools to streamline multi-platform publishing. Other new features include something called a folio showcase, push notification for deep linking and a new digital magazine service. "Content marketing is the new black,” or so it’s hoped by Adobe. Get the details via Adobe’s blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00305J0WhDP0L0A00> .

Power To The People

Digital agency MRY’s CMO David Berkowitz tells Digiday that Facebook’s recent changes <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0300Jqi6>  to its consumer privacy controls will work positively for all involved. “If Facebook can educate consumers more about advertising, consumers are going to be in a far better position to reward good advertising and object to bad advertising,” says Berkowitz.

Video Ad Fraud Ad

How big is the video ad fraud problem? According to Ad Age, Specific Media’s Vindico thinks it warrants a New York City billboard. See it now <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B03AAl0D9J00> .

Data Viz Update

Data visualization – beyond an Excel graph – still remains an unachieved holy grail in ads and marketing. The NY Times Bits blog gets a sneak peek on a new update from Tableau Software and though nothing is mentioned specifically, the need for more storytelling from “big data” is clear.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Sorrell On AMEX

LinkedIn’s Dan Roth assumes the role of interviewer in a conversation with WPP Group chief Martin Sorrell for a piece on Linkedin. Sorrell comments on American Express, saying it’s going 100% programmatic (which AMEX walked back a bit <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqCP04A0LB0WAC0230000xD> ): “The financial services companies tend to be amongst the most sophisticated in the use of online and digital and John Hayes who's the CMO of AmEx has been in the forefront along with Ken Chenault, the CEO, of building their reputation online – not just in programmatic buying but in understanding the importance of targeting.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/F3DBL00yD0W0P2Cq000AA04> .

OMG! Spend

A new IAB-sponsored study by PricewaterhouseCoopers says Internet ad spend in the U.S. continued to rocket in early 2014. From the release: “Internet advertising revenues in the U.S. reached $11.6 billion for the first quarter of 2014, marking a 19 percent increase over the same period in 2013. ... This is an historic first-quarter high and a significant increase over last year’s first-quarter revenue level, which was record-setting at $9.6 billion.” Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0EL0000CP02BAqD30z40A> it.

Mobile Meld

Millennial Media CEO Michael Barrett reached back to his Admeld days for Millennial’s latest hire.  Millennial on Wednesday announced Google mobile exec Marc Theerman, who was part of Admeld before Google bought it in 2011 <http://go.adexchanger.com/lCBqF000L3DP0A2A4000A0W> , would become EVP of business strategy. Theerman’s canned quote in the release was vague as to what he’ll be doing: “As we are at another inflection point in mobile – between programmatic, native advertising and brand – Millennial Media is well positioned in those areas…” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/F3DBL00BG0W0P2Cq000AA04> . Hmm... In 2013, Theerman was more decisive on the future from his personal blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/lCBqH000L3DP0A2A4000C0W> : “24 months from now, the majority of all impressions will come from mobile operating systems. RTB is the only efficient way to match buyers to sellers in this exponentially growing universe.” Boom-shocka-locka-locka.

Buying Location Data

Nokia may own consumer handsets, but it apparently wants to tighten up its location services (a.k.a. targeting) capabilities with its acquisition of Medio Systems. TechCrunch’s Ingrid Lunden reports, “Medio, based out of Seattle, was founded in 2004, originally setting out to develop a contextualised search engine for mobile phone users but later pivoting to provide a more B2B product, in the form of analytics, predictive modelling, and push marketing based on a company’s users’ data.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DDA02000BWC0q43ILP0A> .

Negative Space Ads

Reporter Steven Perlberg explores whether consumers would be willing to pay for ads free television in The Wall Street Journal. Perlberg admits, “There’s one big flaw with this idea, of course: the current bundling of TV networks in pay TV subscriptions. Because consumers don’t pay individually for channels, pricing channels on an ad-free basis would be complicated.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PJBED000qA2C04L03> . This isn’t a new concept as media and marketing tech companies look to the negative space of ads for revenue opportunities. For example, SpotXchange started SkipIt <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWF400K0ABD00C03L02P0Aq>  a couple of years ago – a service for skipping online video ads.

Brian Jacobs On Fraud

In a blog post for MyersBizNet detailing the road from fraud to ad collaboration, ad industry veteran Brian Jacobs, a partner at consulting firm Optisca, predicts that the tipping point will arrive "when the first client of a large holding company not only decides to resist the lure of the holding company’s trading desk but gets so thoroughly disenchanted and annoyed by the lack of transparency and basic honesty on show that he fires the holding company’s media planning agency, creative agency and every other agency owned by the offending holding company and goes instead for a different approach, maybe even going down the bespoke, independent route."

TV Advertising To Keep The Lead

TV ad spend will outpace digital video six to one in 2018 despite digital video advertising's rapid growth, according to an eMarketer report released Thursday. By year's end, digital video spend will increase 41.9% to $5.96 billion and TV advertising will increase 3.3% to $68.54 billion. EMarketer principal analyst David Hallerman says, “Time spent with digital video is growing significantly, and it’s taking away some TV time, but given the diversity of placements and platforms, digital video viewers are more difficult for advertisers to target.” Read the report <http://go.adexchanger.com/gI0D40L0q203BA0AW000NCP> .

Programmatically Engaged

Independent media agency Horizon Media has teamed up with True[X] (formerly SocialVibe) to bring “engagement-based buying” to brand clients. Horizon’s agency trading desk will tap True[X]’s exchange to build internally what the company has heralded as an engagement-based buying practice. “It appears to be the first time [where engagement metrics – such as video views, social media likes/shares, clicks, submitted survey forms, etc.] will be used as the linchpin for programmatic pricing,” says AdWeek.

*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W03PA0q0R0BAL0PDv2> Data-Driven Thinking column...Fraud And Programmatic RTB: Perverse Incentives by Chris O'Hara, Bionic Advertising Systems "The biggest question lately is whether or not we can make it as convenient – and cheap – to buy guaranteed media at scale. Seeing this opportunity, a lot of players in programmatic RTB are looking hard at the money being spent on guaranteed media..." (visit AdExchanger)

Telcos, he said, have extremely valuable consumer data and can deliver context in the form of location, identity and relationships. For Wang, SingTel’s two consecutive purchases demonstrate that the telco is scrambling..." (visit AdExchanger)

"TMS as a category belies the value of these tools,” said Andrew Jones, industry analyst at Altimeter Group. “Yes, it speaks to their original value proposition of making it easier to manage and implement tags and that’s not going away. But the ability to sense customer behaviors in real time, and to act on them…is why we’re seeing a shift in emphasis..." (visit AdExchanger)

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Undertone Acquires

Ad network Undertone on Wednesday bought Upfront Digital Media for an undisclosed sum. According to the release, Upfront Media, formerly Legolas Media, offers “cross-screen programmatic direct and private exchange capabilities to Undertone.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0XL0000vP02BAqD30Z40A> . Undertone is aiming for a programmatic story. Meanwhile, Upfront has fewer than 10 employees, according to LinkedIn <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PZB00000Aw4Dq023W00> , including an engineering team with experience working on sell-side tech.

More Fraud

In Ad Age, reporter Alex Kantrowitz unravels a story about fraud in the digital ad ecosystem. He begins, “Some of the globe's most recognizable brands – including Oreo, GlaxoSmithKline, Burger King and Sprint – were bilked out of millions of dollars by a Florida company that used fake websites to skim from the ad-tech ecosystem…”  Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00001L0wW00AD2q03A04> .

Investing In Personal Data

Krux Digital raised $35 million in funding, the sell-side, digital-data startup announced on Wednesday. The recent funding brings the company's valuation to about $150 million. Investment in DMPs like Krux is on an uptick as the industry aims to collect more information on consumers' online and real-world behaviors. Google, Facebook, Adobe and Oracle control much of this information, and each of these companies has made moves to buy personal-data corporations. Read more via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/Aw0104WB200A3Pq00L020DA> .

Twitter Direct

Twitter has made it easy to buy retargeting ads directly rather than go through an Ads API partner. As of Wednesday, “advertisers who have already created a snippet of code (a tag) for conversion tracking <http://go.adexchanger.com/g30D40L0q203BA0AW0002wP>  can use it for website remarketing,” it said in ablog post. <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D3BqA0020P0W4Aw300>  Retargeting through its API partners continues to work as before.

Digital CRM Funds

Indian digital CRM firm Vizury announced that it has raised $16 million – led by Intel Capital – to fuel growth in China, Japan, Latin America, Middle East and Korea, among other priorities. The United States is still a possibility, Vizury CEO Chetan Kulkarni told the Ecommerce Times. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/DW540040ABD00w03L02P0Aq> . In late 2013, Kulkarni told AdExchanger that he preferred to position Vizury as a digital CRM company rather than an agency or tech company. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0P5B00000Aw4Dq023W60> . Vizury and Merkle would be an interesting global combination.

Alibaba’s Mobile Road Map

Alibaba is acquiring the rest of UCWeb in a cash and stock deal, as the Chinese e-commerce giant aims to add a search engine and an application store to its existing mobile services. Analyst for ICBC International Research You Na estimates that  “UCWeb could also work with Alibaba’s mapping unit to provide location-based services.” Ben Jiang, a spokesman for UCWeb, declined to disclose the pricing of the deal.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

SingTel Buys Ads

Singapore Telecom is acquiring AdConion for $235 million and Kontera for $150 million. The acquisition was processed through the Asia telecom’s mobile ad subsidiary, Amobee, which has platform dreams. With the deals, CEO Mark Strecker says, "Amobee offers the most advanced mobile advertising technology and solutions to large advertisers and publishers on a global scale." Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWG400z0ABD00q03L02P0Aq> 

Opera Too

TechCrunch reports that Opera Mediaworks may be about to acquire mobile video ad startup AdColony for up to $275 million. TechCrunch opines that “given Opera’s interests in connected TVs, you can see where a video-focused play makes a lot of sense.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/I030HWD0L4PA0A2q0q0BA00> . In January, AdColony said it had passed a $100 million gross ad revenue revenue run rate on an annual basis. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW03B0B4L0I2AAP00q0Dq00> .

Internalizing Media

Progressive is the latest brand to bypass agencies and bring programmatic in-house. Adweek reports on the company’s work with Turn, which follows internalization moves by Kimberly-Clark, Unilever, Kellogg’s and others. Some argue big agencies such as Starcom and OMD still have the competitive edge. “Programmatic buying is ridiculously complex,” one anonymous source told Adweek. “We will beat you every time at the auction.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLqWJ0AP3C020qD40> .

Levinsohn Out At Guggenheim

Ross Levinsohn is leaving his post as CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media after joining the investment firm in January 2013. Formerly the interim CEO of Yahoo, where he was instrumental in the 2011 acquisition of Interclick, Levinsohn oversaw investments in digital properties and managed company-owned publications such as the Hollywood Reporter, Billboard and Adweek. During his time at Guggenheim, Levinsohn bid to buy both Hulu and Vevo but neither deal came to fruition. His destination is unknown.

Retargeting The Data

Shopzilla is pooling together the data it collects across e-commerce sites and using the integrated insights to let marketers bid on and place targeted Internet ads. Shopzilla formally (re)launched its Connexity division on Monday. Read more at Internet Retailer. <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP3L0qq0AD00B4E020W0>  As faithful readers may recall <http://go.adexchanger.com/F3DBL00MF0W0P2qq000AA04> , Connexity is the name of the media-buying platform the company acquired in early 2014.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic Direct...Only?

Has the open exchange outlived its usefulness? In an interview with Beet.TV, Chief Investment Officer Ari Bluman says GroupM will limit its programmatic buying to private exchange deals struck directly with publishers. He says this will happen by year’s end. "That is our drive, to only buy direct from publishers using pipes to do so. Every brand that we speak to is very excited about that evolution. They understand the benefits.” A big change! So where does GroupM propose to obtain all the inventory its clients require? “For very large brands, it might take 500 individual deals to come through the pipes. It's a lot of setup work.” Watch the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4d0s0P00qD002LBW0MA3> .

Selling The Software

"What we’re seeing now is programmatic in-sourcing," DataXu Founder and CEO Mike Baker says in an interview with Forbes. "It’s about brands and agencies acknowledging that software is playing an increasingly large role in advertising, and looking to acquire the talent and tools to operate that software inside their organizations." Baker says ownership and control of all the data created through digital media is vital for competing in the ad tech provider space. Baker also hints at a potential DataXu IPO on the horizon. Read the interview in full at Forbes <http://go.adexchanger.com/q3AW0A0DLt004d02B0PN00q> .

Bonjour Cannes

Cannes Lions Festival is fast approaching and "access to this many and this level of decision-makers is rare," TubeMogul Senior VP-International Marc Galens tells Ad Age. With marketers, publishers and agencies descanting on France in full force, the challenge for ad tech companies might be convincing the industry that automation software matters to creative. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B03AAu0DOd00> .

In-House Creative

In 2008, 40% of marketers operated in-house creative agencies but a survey of 200 marketers last year by the Association of National Advertisers saw that figure grow to 56%. Apple is one giant making the shift, and the WSJ reports that Google is also using internal creative teams in addition to its dealings with ad firms. The move in-house reflects marketers’ desire to reduce ad costs and responds to evolutions in digital advertising like the rise of social media marketing. “The sacrosanct marriage between client and agency is dead,” said Russel Wohlwerth, a principle at External View Consulting Group. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/G3B0Ad20Dv4PW0AL0000P0q> .

Roadmapping Ad Quality

On Monday, the IAB launched a "Trustworthy Digital Supply Chain Initiative" that aims to combat fraudulent ad impressions and pirated content. "There is no such thing as a completely trustworthy supply chain," writes Mike Zaneis, IAB’s SVP. "Most of our efforts are directed at fighting criminal activity, and it’s impossible to stamp out all crime. But we can implement successful programs that make it difficult for the criminals to be successful." Read more at the IAB <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40Q0A2d0BwLD0W3P00q0A0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Organic Search Vs. Ads

Marketers have complained as organic reach of their pages has been throttled, apparently, while Facebook ramps up its ads strategy. Last Thursday, Facebook ads product team lead Brian Boland (AdExchanger 2013 interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0030M80WnDP0L0A00> ) defended his company with reasons behind organic reach’s decline, beginning with the idea that  “more and more content is being created and shared every day.” In other words, Facebook can’t show everything. Read more reasons <http://go.adexchanger.com/uN0000DB4L0A0o028PqWA30> . PandoDaily’s James Robinson finds the argument disingenuous but Facebook’s strategy inevitable –read that one <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02O000p8003PW04DABAqL0> .

Attributing Weather

The data of weather remains a compelling opportunity for marketers. Weather Company believes it’s at the center of the storm (rim shot). Weather’s VP of monetization, Alex Linde, describes to Ad Age a new partnership with Placed’s Placed Attribution product, which will “help advertisers see the amount of people their mobile campaigns are sending to physical locations, freeing them from some of the attribution methods currently employed in online advertising.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP03008qqP> . And read AdExchanger’s 2013 article <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PrBQD000qA2804L03>  on Placed and its attribution initiative.

Marketing Cloud To The Rescue?

Salesforce has been able to stay one step ahead of the competition by offering its customer relationship management software in the cloud. But it may not be in the lead for long. Based on the company's Q1 earnings, Wedbush Securites analyst Steve Koenig says Salesforce's product is slower than expected. Read more at Investor's Business Daily <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ts0W80P03000DBR20L4qAA0> . Marketing cloud (i.e., ExactTarget, Buddy Media, Pardot, et al.) to the rescue? Maybe.

To The App

In a new report, eMarketer analysts say that niche search apps – like KAYAK – will increasingly impact Google’s search ad revenue over the next four years as the user moves from the desktop Web to the mobile app. eMarketer says that the niche search engine impact “caused Google’s (search) share to drop to 68.5% in 2013, while the long tail of ‘other’ (i.e., app) companies increased share from 5.4% to 22.9%. This year, we expect Google’s share to fall again, to 65.7%, while the ‘other’ category reaches 27.3%.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0tL00008P02BAqD30S40A> .

Campaigning Content

Ecommerce is evolving thanks to online scrapbooking sites and social sharing platforms like Pinterest and Instagram. Curalate is among a growing set of software startups looking to help brands capitalize on the trend. Already working with some major retail clients such as Urban Outfitters, Curalate helps brands locate their product images around the Web and use them for more candid campaigning and consumer targeting.

The FTC Thinks So by Gary Kibel, Davis & Gilbert "While the ad tech industry has been humming along with the belief that it only uses anonymous data, regulators and legislators have steadily and deliberately expanded the definition of personal information in recent years. As a result, many ad tech companies are sitting on vast amounts of personal information and are the very data brokers about which the FTC is concerned..." (visit AdExchanger)

Last October, it bought MoPub and followed that up this year with what it billed as 'a complete solution for direct-sold and exchange-traded native ads,' which included a native ads SDK, a publisher-side ad server and an RTB extension..."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook Video Retargeting

Facebook added some features around video ads, including retargeting users who saw a brand’s earlier videos. Only large brands need apply! “Advertisers who work with a Facebook account representative can work with us to create audiences of people who have already watched their videos. Ads can be created for those specific people, helping to move them from awareness to affinity and consideration,” says the press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000U2A20L0B0WA4PDAq> 

Pinterest’s Self-Serve Ads

A new self-serve option from Pinterest lets marketers bid to display "promoted pins" on the scrapbooking platform. It’s all about the SME. Facebook is going hard after small biz, but Pinterest might be better positioned in light of the shopper intent built into its platform. “People use Pinterest when they are thinking or dreaming about the future," said Don Faul, Pinterest’s head of operations, "They’ve declared an intent." Read more via The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D2BqA0020P0WBAUX00> .

Automation’s Problem

“Programmatic, exchange-based ad trading has been with us for close to five years now. Are you impressed yet?" Doug Weaver asks ComScore co-founder and Chairman Gian Fulgoni in this week's installment of The Drift. For the record, Fulgoni is "very impressed by the ability of programmatic to lower transaction cost." But! A “big issue with the exchanges … is the prevalence of non-human traffic." Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0YL0000UP02BAqD20C40A> . Comscore bought AdXpose and its brand safety tech in 2011 <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqZP04A0LB0WAU0220000DD> .

Sell Smarter

Publishers need to rethink their programmatic ad sales strategies or risk the dismemberment of sales teams, says Business Insider's chief revenue officer, Pete Spande, writing for Digiday. Spande says, "If we’re not careful about the rollout of programmatic, we could again be headed for four, six or even eight-legged sales meetings, unhealthy internal competition, unnecessary integration teams, and lengthy and expensive re-orgs that don’t really ‘take.’” To get smart about programmatic, Spande suggests publishers invest in team training, simplify workflow and connect with others who are also struggling through the transition.

Yieldbot Raises $18M

"I've always believed that publishers are sitting on a gold mine of first-party data. We wanted to create a technology that would mine all that gold," CEO Jonathan Mendez told Ad Age.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

P&G Programmatic

Sources tell Ad Age’s Jack Neff that “Procter & Gamble wants to buy 70% to 75% of its U.S. digital media programmatically by the end of this year.” Neff notes that this is significant for several reasons, not the least of which is this is a brand advertiser rather than a direct-response advertiser (like American Express, which also made similar programmatic proclamations). Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P02mA0000q0Da20LAWK> . The P&G shift is likely good news for AudienceScience, which has been a programmatic platform of choice for the CPG giant. See AdExchanger’s 2013 interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0bK2WPn0A00>  with CEO Mike Peralta. AudienceScience offered AdExchanger “no comment” on Wednesday.

TV Streaming Explodes

Online TV consumption is booming, and recent findings from Adobe's Digital Benchmark Report quantify the trend. In 2014's first quarter, the US market saw a 246% spike YoY, with iOS apps responsible for pulling 43% market share. The figure for TV Everywhere streaming saw a similar jump, increasing 133% YoY, according to the report. One-fifth of all pay-TV American households are streaming TV across multiple screens, says Adobe's VP for prime time, Jeremy Helfand, and the industry is transforming rapidly to meet consumer demands. Go here <http://go.adexchanger.com/G2B0AK20Do4cW0AL0000P0q>  for Adobe’s report and read more at The Next Web <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000P2p00q2d0K> .

Programmatic TV

TV measurement and analytics firm Rentrak <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DeA02000BWK0q42qLP0A>  said on its earnings conference call Tuesday that “programmatic” has become its third-largest source of revenue. CEO Bill Live explained to analysts that when “software platform clients want to automate processes so they can buy ...  inventory, they are using Rentrak (data).” Read more on Seeking Alpha <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0fK0L20DB0r0W0q4P20A0A> .

Targeting Tablet-top

Bidding for ad placements on tablets or PCs? Microsoft says it’s the same experience and has decided to package both into one targeting category for its search ads offering on Bing. A Bing Ads blog post from exec David Pann explains the combination of desktop/tablet, saying, “Studies show that consumers search on PCs and tablets in very similar ways, resulting in only a 15-20 percent variance in performance between them.“ Hmm. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/q2AW0A0DLs004K02B0Pg00q> .

Mobile’s OOH Impact

"Mobile data is one of the OOH industry’s biggest game-changers in a decade,” says James Davies, Posterscope's chief strategy officer. On Wednesday, the company released results from a trial campaign for Lenovo, which showed that OOH ads are 200% more effective when mobile devices are used in campaigning. "We can now accurately identify which outdoor sites are seen by users of particular websites or apps and what they are doing on their mobile devices at the time," explained Davies. "For example, we now know Surbiton and London’s Caledonian Road stations both deliver major peaks in visits to fashion-related websites, so placing relevant OOH adverts in those areas will increase ad effectiveness.” Read on via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0hK2WPt0A00> .

Anti-Trust Is Real

The PowerReviews and Bazaarvoice denouement arrived yesterday after the FTC ruled the two companies’ 2012 combination would create a monopoly around online ratings and reviews.

CarsDirect discussed display ad initiatives with AdExchanger in May <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0v0P4qA02000WLE0B0A2DB> .

Singtel Buying?

That’s what The Wall Street Journal says as telecom Singtel, which acquired Amobee in 2013 <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PCB00000Av4Dq022WF0>  and funded Nexage in 2012 <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqDB022LW004D0P0AAG0v00>  through its investment arm, may be ready to offer $160 million for Kontera – formerly known as a pay-per-click ad network (2010 AdExchanger article <http://go.adexchanger.com/Av0E04WB200A2Pq00L0H0DA> ).

Online To Off

Rocket Fuel is stretching its digital media-buying platform offline with help from a new Nielsen Catalina Solutions (NCS) partnership. According to Rocket Fuel’s release, its platform’s connection to NCS’ in-store data will help advertisers “understand consumer purchases resulting from programmatically served ads via in-flight optimization.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0vWD0LH000B40002K> . Online to off and back again: an emerging industry theme.

Digital Shifting TV

In the past, GroupM’s media buying group has made select C7 agreements (for measuring time-shifted viewing over seven days) with broadcasters for specific clients, but will now expand it to a wider range of its clients during upfronts. Ad Age reports that both Fox and CBS confirmed they've struck C7 agreements with a major agency but declined to say which one. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PIDvA40L2B00LA> . Under the current C3 model, “advertisers pay based on three days of commercial viewing,” says the WSJ (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0Mv2WPJ0A00> .

Native’s Bright Future

In a roundup feature on the future of native advertising, Steve Edwards, digital sales director at Hearst UK, says, "Increasingly it’s about publishers taking control of the message and advertisers and brands coming along with us. Getting distribution right and getting measurement metrics right, how we actually measure success. How we can create work that is as good as the editorial that surrounds it. Take the logo off it, does it still work?" Digiday has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0N2A00KvD0AP00040> .

When Strategics Strike

On Tuesday, Rubicon Project and Comcast (Comcast Ventures is an investor <http://go.adexchanger.com/F2DBL00PM0W0P2vq000AA04> ) announced a partnership to let marketers buy display ads programmatically for XFINITY.com and xfinityTV.com. Comcast VP Tom Straszewski explained, "The overlying need is that the advertising community is certainly looking for more efficient ways to purchase ad inventory, and particularly display inventory." Straszewski added that Comcast will look to expand the offerings to programmatic mobile ad sales "once this relationship matures."

Data-Driven Results

VentureBeat VP for Product John Koestiert breaks down Adobe's recent digital marketing optimization study in an article published on Tuesday. Koestiert says the most successful digital advertisers are not necessarily investing more than the competition. Data is the secret sauce. "Data-driven is most definitely the way to go. ... Digital marketing is not just something for companies to throw money at. It’s a core competency to engrain in your DNA."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Expanding The People

MediaPost’s Joe Mandese reports that Nielsen’s TV “people meter” will expand to the mobile device which includes smartphones and tablets. A goal, among several, is to capture the much-discussed “second-screen” TV audience. Mandese writes, “Nielsen said a ‘full rollout’ of mobile devices in its electronic TV measurement system would be completed by April 2015, but it did not say when and how it would integrate TV viewing on mobile devices in its national and local TV ratings estimates.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W028A0q0A0BAL0PD62> .

The Fraud Frenzy

Writing for the IAB, Integral Ad Science President and CEO Scott Knoll suggests that the impact of fraud on the ad industry might be overexaggerated. "A year ago, I was concerned because I felt that the industry was not talking enough about the fraud problem," writes Knoll. "Now, I am worried about the opposite. If we’re not careful, we are going to get carried away and cause irreparable harm to the future of digital advertising." Knoll highlights two key factors that exacerbate the fraud debate. Limits in technology cloud the detection process, he says, which can label entire sites as fraudulent based on minimal bot traffic. Secondly, the commercialized capitalization of companies cropping up to combat fraud is only feeding the frenzy. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP2B06q0AD00B49020W0> .

iBeacon Explainer

An article by The Wall Street Journal explores Apple’s iBeacon technology - and hints at the potential for local ads. The WSJ explains: “Apple's iBeacon allows apps to locate a user within a few inches, so that a phone can direct a driver to the nearest open spot in a parking garage or the shortest hot-dog line in a crowded stadium. It allows restaurant diners to pay the check and leave without a waiter's assistance or museum-goers to learn about exhibits by walking past.” Read more (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L02qW0D00aACB064PA> .

Net Neutrality Ad Prognosis

Ad Age offers a forecast for what net neutrality could mean for online advertising, and the outlook isn't too bright. "Pricing will go up for access from a marketing perspective in terms of CPMs," said ad-buying firm Collective's CEO and founder, Joe Apprendi. If this is the case, smaller publishers and ad tech firms might lose out to larger firms that can afford to may for speedier data delivery.

Google Clips Its Coupons

Google discontinued its online coupon product Zavers, which launched 17 months ago. The offering let online shoppers collect coupons for use in-store at partnering retailers. Zavers cancellation came at the command of Google's new commerce chief, Sridhar Ramaswamy and was likely due to the program’s stalled expansion. In an email to Re/code, one Google spokesperson said, "We’re working closely with clients during the transition and remain focused on connecting shoppers with the brands they love through offerings like Product Listing Ads, Google Shopping Express and Google Wallet."

Projecting Twitter’s Growth

Twitter could grow to be a $5 billion business by 2016, predicts a a Seeking Alpha report released Monday. Ad revenue could hit $4.8 billion by 2016, despite Twitter's dealing user growth. Although the projections are positive, Twitter showed a low RPM of $1.4 in 2014's first quarter. This might be due to Twitter's evolving ad products, or Twitter's desire not to bombard users with in-feed ads. Yet, Twitter benefits from its in-stream ads, and its CPM is reportedly seven times higher than Facebook. Read Seeking Alpha’s findings <http://go.adexchanger.com/f006A0L0DG002B2qW0AeP04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Patenting Prevention

Online ad tech firm Dstillery says it has received a patent for some of its fraud-prevention technology. The press release says that the patent covers detection of “non-intentional traffic (NIT) based on co-visitation information and flags websites as suspicious to enable spurious traffic to be filtered out and to prevent ads from being served to fraudulent website visits.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A400Y0P00qD002LBW0wA2> . And see the patent on the USPTO site <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW02Z0B4L0x2AAP00q0D000> . The multifaceted ad safety biz remains brisk and competitive. Mature startups like Integral Ad Science <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP02000q0y> , DoubleVerify <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D2BqA0020P0WzA0100>  and Moat and larger companies like ComScore and Nielsen can attest.

AppNexus And Alibaba

The Wall Street Journal reports that online ad exchange and tech platform AppNexus is looking to raise $100 million at a rumored $1 billion valuation and may receive investment from e-commerce giant Alibaba. The $1 billion is more than double competitor Rubicon Project’s current <http://go.adexchanger.com/f000A0L0DA002B2qW0A2P04> , public market valuation. The WSJ: “Alibaba operates China's biggest online marketplaces. Its main website, Taobao, generates much of its revenue through advertising. The people familiar with the matter said Alibaba is looking to gain advertising expertise from AppNexus, while AppNexus hopes Alibaba can help it expand beyond the U.S.” Read more (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0P3B00000A04Dq022WB0> . Twitter bought MoPub before going public. Perhaps there is a strategic echo here as Alibaba preps to go public: Get ready for more (programmatic) ads.

No Programmatic

Publisher ad exec Trevor Fellows of The Wall Street Journal says in an interview with eMarketer that his company will never implement programmatic video advertising. “If you’re a premium brand like ours, we can best sell our clients by having direct conversations and understanding their objectives really well. Having an intermediary do so via an exchange or a network makes no sense whatsoever for us.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40C0A200B4LD0W2P00q0A0> . Fellows appears to be addressing nonguaranteed vs. guaranteed or direct-programmatic opportunities.

Bidding For Video

More Alibaba!! The Chinese e-commerce company is evidently going after online video viewers, the company announced late last week. Ads will now appear on both Taobao and Tmall, Alibaba's online shopping platforms. Additionally, Alibaba is placing ads on several other video sites, including Youku Tudou, known as "China's YouTube." The company has invested $1.2 billion into its video advertising strategy and says retailers can bid for placements as early as next month.

“Right To Be Forgotten” Process

In a play-by-play explainer, Search Engine Land breaks down the European Union's new "Right To Be Forgotten" ruling established earlier this month. The removal form prompts individuals to submit a photo ID, and allows submitters to request links they want removed from Google's search engine. URL removal will only happen in the EU, for EU versions of Google. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0260B4L0E2AAP00q0D000> .

Delivery And Advertising

Google and Amazon have been in direct competition since the companies both announced same-day delivery services in Los Angeles earlier this month. As the companies extend operations to more cities, it remains to be seen which will dominate the e-commerce market. "The push to get consumers to buy from Google is really about advertising," writes Bruce Kelly for Investopedia, "If Google can consumers to buy products after an online search, the company shows its advertisers how effective its ads really are." With e-commerce amounting to $225 billion last year alone, the race is on and the stakes are high. Read more at Investopedia <http://go.adexchanger.com/uG0000DB4L0A08020PqWA20> .

Selfie

Street Fight reports on a new native ad unit offered by a company called Broadstreet, “which provides ad services to news publisher.” The unit is called the “Selfie” and is described as a “short, self-generated messages that businesses and anybody else can place in the middle of an article to catch the eye of searching users.” Read how it works <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D2BqA0020P0WHA0900> . Broadstreet is co-founded by former Right Media Exchange engineer Kenny Katzgrau <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P02aA0000q0DI20LAW0> .

Mohan On Video

In a canned interview on the DoubleClick Advertiser blog, Neal Mohan previews this Wednesday’s annual DoubleClick digital advertising summit (see more <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000b2040qA2LPDB0J0WA0> ). Mohan says, “Video has been very much on my mind lately. Getting video right is something that is essential to our brand, agency and publisher partners. … Expect to hear more about what we have planned to help make that happen.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40K0A200BcLD0W2P00q0A0> .
