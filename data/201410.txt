 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

The Kraft Of Digital 

“We're not looking to drive down advertising costs per se. We're driving for improved advertising effectiveness,” said Kraft EVP and CFO Teri List-Stoll during the company’s quarterly earnings call. “We're also realizing meaningful efficiencies as we shift our spending to more targeted digital media.” Digital accounted for more than 35% of Kraft’s total ad spend in Q3, a 25% increase YoY. Read the Q3 earnings transcript via Seeking Alpha <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0d5A0000q0DB20LAWR> . The theme echoes CMO Deanie Elsner’s recent speech at the ANA Masters of Marketing conference. Read Joanna O’Connell’s take <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PC40R0D6Adq2> . 

Insta Video Ads 

Instagram debuted video ads for the first time on Thursday, after a six-month trial period. The first brand clients to test drive the unit are Disney, Activision, Lancome, Banana Republic and CW. "Our audience is becoming increasingly mobile-centric, and Instagram is a mobile-centric platform,"Jonathan Anastas, head of digital and social media at Activision, told Adweek. "So it's an important part of the marketing mix." Added Brian Chang, assistant VP of media at Lancome USA, “It wasn’t a hard decision for us. We, as a brand, wanted to take advantage of being first to market.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0DdA007RD0AP00040> . 

Fighting The Showroom 

Wal-Mart is considering taking its brick-and-mortar price-matching program online this holiday season, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. In general, the big-box retailer hasn’t been able to maintain a pricing advantage against its competitors since 2012, according to a study by Kantar. The move could make Wal-Mart more competitive, but it also carries the risk of a decline in revenue as a result of price cuts. During a call with investors earlier this year, Wal-Mart’s chief merchant Duncan Mac Naughton confirmed, “We’re doubling down to make sure that we show price gaps across the marketplace.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0ER0Ld0DB080W0q4P20A0A> . Also, read our recent article on Wal-Mart’s e-commerce “engine.” <http://go.adexchanger.com/jq9B0d2LW004D0P0AAF0R00>  

Opera Dollars 

Opera Mediaworks reported quarterly revenues of $138.8 million, a whopping 84% percent year-over-year increase. During 2014’s Q3, Opera Mediaworks inked a deal to buy mobile video platform AdColony, and the company now credits mobile video for half of its revenue. “Our Q3 results and the addition of AdColony, positions us the no.1 independent mobile ad platform globally,” claimed Opera Mediaworks CEO Mahi de Silva in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqaB0d2LW004D0P0AAG0R00> . “While generating record revenues, we are also delivering very healthy profits, in sharp contrast to other mobile ad tech companies.” Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0dbA0000q0DH20LAWR> . And, read our July article <http://go.adexchanger.com/icRW00BdPIL00A000Dq2A04> . 

Content Marketing Funding 

Visible Measures completed a $7 million fundraising round on Thursday, bringing the ad tech start-up’s total funding to $70 million. The company has leaned heavily into pitching programmatic and native advertising to its marketing clients, which include Microsoft, P&G and Ford. In a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/gJ0D40L0q20dBA0AW000dRP> , CEO and founder Brian Shin said, “This funding enables us to continue pushing the boundaries of the emerging Content Advertising category, which combines critical aspects of Content Marketing, Programmatic Advertising, and Marketing Automation.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Publishers For Programmatic 

Publisher Northern & Shell is investing heavily in programmatic, digital channels and its CRM systems, The Drum reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tt0WN0P0d000DB320L4qAA0> . “Everyone’s completely behind digital and programmatic within the business. There are a lot of new skill sets needed from traditional media, so there’s been a bit of a shift,” said Ben Hancock, Northern & Shell’s head of programmatic. “We’re making a huge investment in our own CRM platforms here – one of the most valuable things we have around is data, and it’s something we need to be careful with, a key strategy around our monetisation.” Though Hancock refrained from detailing exactly how much of its advertising is happening programmatically, he said the percentage is “significant.” 

Enterprise-Grade Twitter Data 

IBM will integrate Twitter’s social data into its analytics and cloud systems, and will build new enterprise-grade apps that leverage the fire hose for customer engagement and other uses. “While companies have long listened to what their customers are saying on Twitter, complex enterprise decisions often require input from a lot of different systems,” Twitter said in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000N24d0L0B0uA4PDAq> . And Twitter thinks IBM’s cloud-analytics platform is the system for the job. According to Chris Moody, Twitter’s VP of bizdev, this partnership “had been years in the making.” Business Insider has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWN4dA00vL0PB052> . 

AppNexus On Defense 

“We do not knowingly ever pay sellers for invalid traffic,” AppNexus CTO Geir Magnusso said in an interview with Ad-Exchange.fr that was syndicated on ExchangeWire <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0dwA0q060BAL0PDN2> . “A difference between AppNexus and some other companies is that as a technology platform, many ad networks use us to power their businesses. These ad networks have direct relationships with publishers who are sellers in their networks. Some of these sellers the networks may know extremely well, and some of those sellers may be new to the networks or sign up through a self-service offering.” Magnusson added, “When we find a client who is having issues with invalid traffic from their sellers, we immediately ban those sellers and work with our client to clean up how they vet new publishers for their network.” Read AdExchanger’s interview with CEO Brian O'Kelley <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00D7A02000BWN0q4dxLP0A> . 

MDC Partners Reports 

MDC Partners reported Q3 earnings on Wednesday, with revenue increasing 13.2% to $326.9 million. CEO Miles Nadal pointed to programmatic as a core part of MDC’s media business. He also highlighted Gale43, a startup that marries technology, consulting, and creative services. Gale43 could grow to be a $50 million firm in the next five years, Nadal said. Read the earnings release <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pdy00q280N> . 

Mobile Wallet Hack 

Well this is awkward. Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) confirmed on Wednesday that its rival app to Apple Pay, CurrentC, has been hacked. The coalition of more than 50 retailers has learned that in the span of 36 hours, unauthorized third parties obtained email addresses tied to CurrentC’s pilot program. In an email to early partners, MCX wrote, “Based on investigations conducted by MCX security personnel, only these email addresses were involved and no other information.” Considering that security remains a key concern as users adopt mobile wallets, this does not bode well for CurrentC.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Buying Programmatic 

Tel Aviv-based performance marketing player Matomy Media Group snapped up mobile programmatic ad platform MobFox for $17.6 million. “The impressive growth of programmatic and mobile advertising has made it clear that both will form an important part of the future of digital advertising,” said Matomy CEO Ofer Druker. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02j000EI00dPW04DABAqL0> . The deal follows a stock sale giving Publicis Groupe 20% of Matomy <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWk400F0ABD00I0dL02P0Aq> . Pair with Publicis’ acquisition of ad platform RUN (AdExchanger story <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0dv0B4L0a2AAP00q0DI00> ). Publicis, ad tech owner! 

Mayer Seeking Reinforcements 

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer wants to hire Amazon’s head of global advertising sales Lisa Utzschneider, according to Re/code’s sources. Though it’s unclear which role Mayer’s looking to fill, sources familiar with the situation say she could be looking for someone to lead Yahoo’s Americas division or take on a potential C-suite position. The rumor comes in the wake of better-than-expected Q3 earnings for Yahoo. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DdBqA0020P0WlAIG00> . 

BuzzFeed’s Data Acqui-Hire 

BuzzFeed is becoming more data savvy <http://go.adexchanger.com/gm0D40L0q20dBA0AW000HIP>  with the purchase of Torando. The data engineering company was co-founded by Todd Levy, who has worked as a software engineer at AOL and subsequently co-founded Bitly. Levy will move into his new role at BuzzFeed as VP of data engineering to lead the 10-strong data science team. BuzzFeed CTO Mark Wilkie was succinct: “We wanted to double down on big data.” Terms were not disclosed. TechCrunch has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/GdB0AI20DI4nW0AL0000P0q> . 

First To The Party   

First-party data is the cat’s pajamas, Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PJDIA40LdB00oA> . And dumb pipes are going away. "Scale without data is becoming less valuable every day," commented Wells Fargo Securities senior analyst Peter Stabler. Facebook built Atlas using first-party data, and marketers like Kraft, Netflix and Kellogg are all about it. But Xaxis CEO Brian Lesser says it’s “getting harder, not easier” to manage that CRM data set. "It's not just having that data, it's also having some machine intelligence able to tease apart that data.” 

Apple Payment Data 

Apple Pay is rapidly becoming a big deal. One million credit cards were activated within 72 hours of the mobile wallet launch last week, CEO Tim Cook said at the WSJD Live Global Technology Conference. More than 220,000 retailers are participating, but NOT Rite Aid, CVS, Wal-Mart or Best Buy. Cook hammered on his privacy message, suggesting transaction data is locked away and unavailable to outside parties, whether those parties are the government or the marketing industry.  “We’re not Big Brother,” he added, “We’ll leave that to others.” MarketWatch has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/AI0K04WB200AdPq00L0p0DA> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Location-Unaware 

Ad Age reporter Kate Kaye lets five consumer-data-gathering firms follow her every move for three weeks and found that location trackers were generally unable to lock down an accurate profile in that timeframe. "Because our algorithm requires a high degree of certainty before it associates a device with a household, it can take more time, and we simply didn't see your device often enough within the time frame of the test to be assured of a match," said Kirsten McMullen, chief privacy officer for 4Info, a participating firm. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqpB0d2LW004D0P0AAb0B00> . 

Reading In The Feed 

Facebook has been making the rounds of publishers in a bid to help them “do a better job of servicing readers in the News Feed,” New York Times media critic David Carr notes in a column. That “help” could include hosting articles wholesale in a rev-share arrangement – an alarming prospect for many. “Publishers are worried that what has been a listening tour could become a telling tour.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tq0WB0P0d000DBc20L4qAA0>  Pair with NYT’s Ravi Somaiya on journalism’s growing dependence on Facebook <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00Bd0ALAWPrdB02q000> . 

Programmatic Remedy 

Cold medicine Zicam is the latest consumer brand to embrace programmatic advertising head-on. The company opted out of TV upfronts this year, and instead quadrupled its digital budget, according to The Wall Street Journal. Because Zicam’s sales peak during cold and flu season, execs say automation is crucial. “Our go-to-market strategy over the past 15 years or so has always been pretty standard: classically trained brand managers doing what they are trained to do,” said M’Lou Arnett, CEO at Zicam parent Matrixx. “Now, we are trying to be much more responsive to the market and flexible. This is what a brand needs to do in 2014.” Zicam is channeling spend through Xaxis, across display, video, mobile and tablet-synced-to-TV ad spots.

The Cost Of iOS 

New data from Fiksu shows that the launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, in addition to Apple’s iOS 8 update, are driving up marketing costs for app downloads and user retention. According to the report <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0dtA0q0f0BAL0PDB2> , “The Cost per Install (CPI) Index measures the cost per app install directly attributed to advertising. September saw the CPI for iOS increase 6 percent to $1.23 – representing a 41 percent increase year-over-year.” Brands vying for app users’ attention may have to shell out a tad more cash as consumers continue to migrate to Apple’s new products.

Amazon’s Media Ambitions, Cont. 

Amazon.com shared plans to buy Internet comedy aggregator Rooftop Media. The company, which will be housed under Amazon subsidiary Audible, distributes through Yahoo and streaming services like Sirius XM, Spotify and Pandora. “Amazon is persisting in buying content to round out its service, with designs to take on Netflix and other online digital media services,” Reuters reports.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Circling The Data Wagons

Retailers are circling the wagons on their first-party, in-store data. MacRumors reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/g10D40L0q20dBA0AW000bxP>  that pharmacy giants CVS and Rite Aid are preparing to block or are blocking ear field communication <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWx4dA00cL0PB022>  capabilities that enable Apple Pay and Google Wallet in favor of its own proprietary digital payment system, CurrentC. Scheduled to launch next year, the new system is the fruit of a retailer consortium known as Merchant Customer Exchange <http://go.adexchanger.com/lxBqd000LdDP0A2A400030W>  or MCX. Mac-lover Jon Gruber proclaims from his Daring Fireball blog that the retailers’ efforts are doomed. DOOMED <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP04e02q0L0AB0Dd00Ax4> .

Cutting Cable’s Cord

After a four-year stretch of positive growth, ad commitments during cable TV networks’ annual summer upfront dropped 6% to $9.6 billion. “Several big-spending advertisers stated that they anticipated spending fewer ad dollars in this year's upfront, and nearly all cited increased flexibility as their reason why,” said Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau president and CEO Sean Cunningham in a statement. “Cable networks are meeting this instinct for immediacy with multiscreen brand programs around hit shows.” Are advertisers holding out for cheaper prices closer to air dates, or are upfront TV dollars shifting to digital channels? Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/g50D40L0q20dBA0AW000fxP> .

In-App Retargeting

A Google Display Network update lets advertisers target users who have made in-app purchases. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PgDxA40LdB006A> , Google aims to enable “developers and marketers to show ads to people who have made in-app purchases through the Play Store.” The new targeting feature is available via the AdWords API. Could Google’s answer to Facebook’s cross-device ID be quietly worked into a dozen features like this -- rather than announced at a splashy event like the Atlas release?

New Lieutenant For Larry

Google’s Sundar Pichai got a major promotion and now runs at least five product units, including ads, Re/code reports. Among those now reporting to Pichai is Sridhar Ramaswamy, who was named last year to run ad product development when Susan Wojcicki <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0d00xqh7>  transferred to YouTube. Pichai will also oversee research, search, maps, Google+, commerce and ad products and infrastructure. All those product chiefs, and Wojcicki too, are 10-plus year veterans of the company. Old Googlers, new layers! Read on. <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLxW80APdi020qD40> 

Video In The Exchange

Unruly and Casale Media’s Index Exchange partnered on a programmatic video trading platform, UnrulyX. In a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DdBqA0020P0W9Axj00> , the companies claim the exchange comes with guaranteed viewability for premium video impressions. "There is no question that viewability is in high demand, and this partnership with Unruly allows us to deliver high-quality, viewable programmatic video inventory that will lead to better outcomes for buyers, while also providing Unruly's publishers with the premium, scalable demand they want and need,” said Alex Gardner, VP of platform solutions at Index Exchange.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Yandex’s Strong Quarter 

Russian search giant Yandex reported a solid Q3 Thursday, with revenue hitting $331.5 million, up 28% YoY. Display advertising accounted for 6% of total revenue in 2014’s third quarter, totaling nearly $20 million. O&O display revenue shrank 3%, but ad network revenue grew an impressive 19% YoY, and don’t forget the company’s acquisition of ad tech platform AdFox. More on that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0dAA20DYr00>  

Meredith Reaps Programmatic Benefits 

Publisher Meredith Corporation saw Q1 2015 revenue grow 4% YoY to $371 million. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0d30B4L0Z2AAP00q0Dr00> . Audience reach for its national brands increased 8% YoY to 180 million monthly visits across print, digital, mobile and video, with about 60 million uniques per month on its digital and mobile properties. CEO Stephen Lacy pointed to 20% growth in digital ad revenue, led by Allrecipes.com, which performed “just absolutely lights out.” CFO Joseph Ceryanec also noted “large gains from our initiative to capture programmatic-related opportunities.” Programmatic grew 100% according to Lacy, though he acknowledged the base is small. This growth occurred because Meredith got its data assets aligned, which allowed it to better monetize its traffic and enter the marketplace with the ability to target online audiences. 

Indexing Social Performance 

Social analytics company Socialbakers partnered with Lenovo to create a social marketing performance tool for brands. CEO Jan Rezab explained that The Social Health Index, released Thursday, gives brands “a way to quantify their return on investment into social relative to their competition. Our development of this index with Lenovo provides a simple way for brands in any industry to do this.” Read on via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4s050P00qD002LBW00Ad>  and go HERE <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0dqW0D006A1B0s4PA>  for AdExchanger’s recent Q&A with Rezab. 

Ads Non Grata 

Ad-free social network Ello raised $5.5 million in new venture funding by the Foundry Group, Bullet Time Ventures and FreshTracks Capital. What’s more, the startup is reorganizing as a public benefit corporation. “It basically means no investor can force us to take a really good financial deal if it forces us to take advertising,” Ello co-founder and CEO Paul Budnitz told the New York Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B02sdWP70A00> . “It points us in the right direction, and it protects us.” So how will Ello monetize? Budnitz said Ello will eventually offer widgets for purchase (think Apple’s app store).

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Sorrell 'Puzzled' By Media Margin Pushback 

Speaking at ad:tech London, WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell said he’s troubled by the debate around transparency and programmatic. Regarding his position on the media sold through WPP’s programmatic arm, Xaxis, Sorrel said, “We decided to do this on an opt-in basis. We ripped up 2,500 media contracts. We explained to clients what was happening and told them they could opt in.” He continued, “Some of them chose not to, largely because of the transparency issue, which I’m a little bit puzzled by because nobody knows what happens when you double click with Google or use Facebook. People don’t know how they work. Algorithms change, and people don’t know how they change.” Sorrell said WPP’s margins are 15 or 16% of revenues, compared to Facebook and Google’s margins in the 40-50% range.

Mayer On Mobile 

In a Q&A with The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said the company’s mobile bet will continue to pay off. “Given the success we have seen on mobile native ads, we think that that only means our mobile revenue will grow commensurately with traffic, as opposed to users,” she said. “We also think that as we get additional advertising demand, experiment with more ad formats, etc., there will be also opportunities to drive up the price per ad.” Mayer said Yahoo’s native mobile ads have performed for advertisers as well as traditional display on desktop.

Privacy Execs’ Revolving Door 

The privacy game is changing, and so are its key regulatory figures. The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a longstanding self-regulatory group whose members include ad networks, lost CEO Marc Groman after a three-year tenure. Concurrently, the FTC brought Ashkan Soltani aboard as chief technologist to lead data privacy efforts. Speaking to Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lnf2fADP0d00A0> , Groman commented on Soltani’s appointment, saying the hire “signals how seriously the FTC takes the issue of privacy and in particular digital privacy.” But Groman noted the decision might ruffle some feathers in the digital ad industry, as Soltani has publicly explored the merits of companies accessing and distributing data for digital advertising purposes.

Twitter Debuts 'Fabric' 

Rumors of Twitter’s app development platform were confirmed Wednesday with the official launch of Fabric. “Two years ago we were at a place in the company’s history where we were looking at what was going on in the mobile landscape,” strategy director Jessica Verrilli told the Financial  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ihnW00BdPhL00A000Dq2A04> Times, “and we knew that we wanted to expand its footprint to be not just a mobile product, but also a mobile platform.” Gigaom reporter Carmel DeAmicis notes that as consumers shift to mobile, ad dollars will follow. “Without having key integrations into native apps, Twitter risks losing a major share of the mobile web advertising market to its competitors,” writes DeAmicis.

Primo Mobile Marketplace 

Private mobile ad exchange startup YieldMo racked up $10 million on Wednesday, adding to the $8 million round of funding it secured last year. YieldMo will use the funds to further develop Ad Format Lab, its mobile marketplace. According to the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0djA0q0j0BAL0PDn2> , “Marketplace is distinct in that it only includes premium advertisers and publishers, and provides transparent reporting down to the placement level.” Time Warner is among these publishers, and led this series of funding. YieldMo is expanding and plans to hire at least 40 in the coming months. Re/code has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqkB0d2LW004D0P0AAk0n00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Apple Eyes Tap-To-Buy 

Apple is rumored to be bringing its mobile payment system, Apple Pay, to iAd. Digiday reports that the integration would embed a tap-to-buy button in mobile ads, mirroring similar moves by Facebook and Twitter earlier this year. Jeff Malmad, managing director of mobile at Mindshare, said the move might help Apple “close the loop” in terms of attribution. “The mobile experience has transformed the shopping experience” added Malmad, “and the ability to understand what consumers are doing on an aggregate level [with iAd] is very powerful for brands.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/GdB0Ai20Dv4AW0AL0000P0q> .

MediaMath CEO Joe Zawadzki shared revenue figures in a presentation at financial backer Safeguard Scientifics’ investor day. Among the metrics: The company does $1 million per month in video advertising, mobile is at about 15% of its inventory and 40% of its business is outside the US. Mergers get some of the credit: “When we launched video, for example, quite quickly through an acquisition, we basically built it into the platform within about 17 months.”  SeekingAlpha transcript. <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00BWqA000dPiA0w040D2L>  

Creative + Data 

WPP’s Ogilvy & Mather wants to add some data flavor to its creative product through a new unit called OgilvyAmp. So far, more than 300 Ogilvy employees are focused there,doing work for clients like IBM, British Airways, E-Trade, Nestlé and T-Mobile. “Data doesn’t replace creativity,” WPP Data Alliance CEO Nick Nyhan told The New York Times, adding that “great creative has lasting power that data may not have predicted. If the creative is bad, even if it’s well-targeted, it’s still going to bomb.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PxBCD000qA2i04L0d> . 

Sizmek Uncorks Dynamic Creative Suite 

Dynamic creative: the discipline everyone wants to get into, if only they had the resources and if only the tech could scale. With that in mind, Sizmek launched a dynamic creative suite, designed to work across mobile, social, video and display. Programmatic, said Sizmek’s product marketing manager, Jaime Singson, drives interest in dynamic creative. Traditionally, programmatic advertisers slap together different templates for different audiences, but there’s now demand for more complex tools, such as authoring environments. “Large-scale advertisers like automotive have different creative versions for different DMAs with different dealership locations,” Singson told AdExchanger. “You’ll have different models to push and local offers and different prices.” Sizmek’s product is designed to support these permutations. 

Video Bullion 

No surprise: With programmatic video platforms flying off the shelves, startups are flocking to the space. Genesis Media unveiled TVGenesis, which lets publishers expose viewers to videos at varying frequency depending on whether they want to maximize yield or engagement. Genesis Media provides backfill on a CPM, CPV or CPCV basis, and publishers can sell the premium, viewable video content themselves. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWD400y0ABD00i0dL02P0Aq> . And, Vdopia unveiled a programmatic buying and selling solution for mobile video. Dubbed Chocolate, it’s built on Vdopia's proprietary .VDO technology. "One of the unique advantages of Chocolate is the capability to provide real-time bidding (RTB) to demand partners which have only basic VAST support but no RTB capability," says CTO Srikanth Kakani.

Mapping Call Sentiment 

Marchex wants to help its customers map and analyze phone calls, including those triggered by mobile ads. Tim Graber, senior director of product and engineering at Marchex, explains, “We built Real-Time Call DNA to reveal all the facets of a conversation, and we are able to do this using technology that anonymously captures data without recording calls. Businesses get immediate, actionable insights on the quality of calls coming from mobile ads – and those insights lead to increased sales performance.” Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0i0P4qA02000WLG0B0AdDB> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Videology Adds TV 

Videology wants to support television buys. Though the firm’s main focus has been on the Internet video marketplace, advertisers and agencies are increasingly coordinating their web and TV budgets. It says 50% of revenue now comes from TV budgets. “Marketers are interested in holistic planning,” said CEO Scott Ferber. “They are saying, ‘Can I bring the addressability of Internet advertising to TV?’ The rubber is hitting the road in convergence. So we think we need a group of individuals dedicated to the current needs of TV advertisers and the future.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0bWD0LH000B4000dT> . 

Gannett’s Digital Road Map 

Gannett reported better than expected earnings on Monday, with net revenue of $136.3 million but digital revenue growth was relatively weak at 4%. The buyout of Cars.com in August may help with that. Gannett’s “geodigital” efforts, dubbed Key Ring <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ab0I04WB200AdPq00L0U0DA> , could also play a role in spurring digital growth. Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0b0P4qA02000WLV0J0AdDB> the earnings report. 

Ready Set Snap 

Over the weekend, Snapchat’s long-awaited first ad made its debut. The ephemeral messaging company opted for a less “native” route than anticipated, launching its ad efforts instead with a 20-second movie trailer for Universal Pictures’ “Ouija.” “We don't know what the metrics are going to be,” Universal Pictures digital marketing VP Doug Neil told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0dK0B4L0W2AAP00q0Db00> . “It's not much different than a traditional linear-viewing experience when you think about it. We put an ad in a primetime TV show; when the ad's over, you don't see it again.” Though valued at $10 billion, Snapchat admitted in a Friday blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0XbdWPL0A00> , “We need to make money.” 

Staq Raises $2.5M 

Ad ops startup Staq closed a $2.5 million round led by Genacast Ventures and Core Capital. The company is led by execs from Rubicon Project, Collective Media and DoubleClick. “We've automated the last mile of ad operations, with programmatic reporting and analytics," said CEO James Curran.The promise is to aggregate and normalize data from different systems, and to help manage revenue from indirect and direct sources. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PMB00000Ab4Dq02dWY0> . 

Twitter’s App ‘Hooks’ 

WSJ has some details on Twitter’s rumored app developer platform, called “Fabric.” According to people familiar with the offering, the offering aims to ease how developers access analytics, fix bugs and make a buck. “It is about relationship-building,” said Ryan Sarver, a partner at venture-capital firm Redpoint Ventures and Twitter’s former director of platform. “If you start by offering services that are globally interesting to mobile developers and not just ones that are interested in traditional Twitter data, you can build a better relationship with more developers and introduce more of them to Twitter by delivering them value right away.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0dNA0q0Z0BAL0PDb2> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Moré For Bolloré 

Bolloré Group wants to increase its stake in Havas Group from 36% to more than 50%. Adweek reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABL4WF0APdm020qD40> , "Havas described the offer as ‘friendly,’ but said its board had appointed an independent expert to assess the terms.” Earlier this year, Bolloré Group scion Yannick Bolloré stepped in as CEO of Havas, and there has been talk of a merger between the agency company and Vivendi, where Bolloré also has a position – but Yannick doesn't love bloat. “We don’t think bigger and fatter is always better,” he said onstage during Advertising Week. Read AdExchanger’s coverage. <http://go.adexchanger.com/gG0D40L0q20dBA0AW000n4P>  

YouTube Vs. Facebook 

Social marketers are moving their video over to Facebook, according to research from social analytics company Socialbakers <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWH400o0ABD0040dL02P0Aq> . “As Facebook has consistently outperformed YouTube in terms of driving views and engagement, content marketers have reacted and have switched to natively published Facebook videos. The subsequent result: YouTube is steadily losing a key distribution platform as content marketers are shifting to Facebook.” But Marketing Land reporter Amy Gesenhues writes <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0I4dWPp0A00> , “The question remains whether or not Facebook offers the same engagement as YouTube when it comes to marketing videos.” Socialbakers CEO Jan Rezab spoke with AdExchanger recently. Read that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0d0JWD0L4Pq0A2q040BA00>  

Courting The Video Publisher 

Video syndication network AirMedia added $2 million in funding to attract premium publishers. Already, the 10-month-old platform has signed up NBC Universal Sports and Cinesport. TechCrunch reports that AirMedia hopes to solve distribution, syndication and quality-control headaches for high-end sellers. Writes TechCrunch reporter Ryan Lawler, “For video owners, the platform provides a way to reach new audiences, but also provides the ability to do all their own promotion and ad sales.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/uK0000DB4L0A0r024PqWAd0> . 

Spies Like Us 

Security researchers at security software vendor Invincea uncovered a new breed of malvertising. Code delivered via ad network placements is behind hacking attempts against three military contractors, according to Invincea. Reuters reports, “The goal of the intrusions appeared to be the theft of military secrets or intellectual property rather than click-fraud or bank account phishing. They noted that some of these companies are producing technology for use in combat zones." Read more. 

B2B, Meet B2C 

At its Masters of Marketing Conference in Orlando, the Association of National Advertisers unveiled plans to absorb the Business Marketing Association. It’s the ANA’s second trade group purchase this year; in May it nabbed the Brand Activation Association. In a statement <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PsBLD000qA2404L0d>  ANA CEO Bob Liodice explained, “The purpose of the business combination is to bring substantial attention and focus to the B-to-B marketing community.” Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/it4W00BdPML00A000Dq2A04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic Gains Speed 

Programmatic ad spend in the US will surpass $10 billion this year, according to  <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0cHA0q0a0BAL0PDV2> eMarketer, and is growing at a rate of 137%. According to the research, ad spend on automation will double to $20.4 billion by 2016. “Today publishers largely guard high-value ad inventory such as TV and premium digital video content, though we expect a greater number of ads sold programmatically in these formats starting in 2015,” said eMarketer analyst Lauren Fisher. “Those who do decide to turn to programmatic, however, are likely to do so via programmatic direct, where they can still secure inventory guarantees.” 

MediaMath Invests In Social 

MediaMath snatched up social ad platform Upcast on Thursday for an undisclosed sum. Upcast’s tech will plug into MediaMath’s TerminalOne platform to support Facebook and Twitter programmatic access. Grant Muckle, Upcast’s managing partner, explains, “MediaMath shares our vision for a dynamic, technology-driven and SaaS-centric future for marketing.” Read the press  <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPcb4B00W000qAV0020AID> release. 

Hear This 

Barely days after Rentrak acquired its US-based TV business, Kantar Media’s made an acquisition of its own. The audience-measurement service has snapped up second-screen advertising platform Civolution’s audio watermarking tools – SyncNow and NexTracker. SyncNow bridges the gap between digital audio and TV, triggering “real-time events” on companion devices by detecting television tune-in through audio tracking. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PJBcD000qA2V04L0c> . 

DSP Tracking 

Location analytics company Placed is swerving into programmatic territory through a partnership with Adelphic. Though Placed already works with a number of agencies, networks and publishers, CEO David Shim said working with a DSP like Adelphic will help expand the companies’ audiences beyond standard media buyers. Shim told AdExchanger, “Location is like gold in that it closes the loop on 90% of retail transactions that occur in the offline world. Only measuring the online impact of digital advertising is like mining for gold without a pick and shovel, where you miss out on the opportunity right under your feet.” Read more via Street  <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DdA02000BWV0q4cKLP0A> Fight. 

Streaming TV 

The immediate business impact of cord cutters may be negligible <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0LL0000VP02BAqDc0e40A>  (according to Forrester Research), but HBO and CBS are future-proofing anyway. On Wednesday, HBO said it will offer a standalone streaming service <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PMDVA40LcB00fA>  in the US in 2015. Its current web portal, called HBO GO, requires a subscription to a cable service or satellite provider. Not to be outdone, CBS launched its online subscription service CBS All Access <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DgA02000BWV0q4cNLP0A> , with thousands of episodes of current and classic shows and TV streaming.

Gentzel Potential 

Agency execs weigh in on Yahoo’s recent hire, former WaPo CRO Kevin Gentzel, and the consensus is bright. DigitasLBi CIO Adam Schlacter says Gentzel “could be a welcome change." Jitka Petrickova, managing partner of MEC's West division, adds that Gentzel will bring vital budget experience to the table. "Budgets over time are not inflatable,” she said. “For Yahoo to grow share [of ad spending], it has to come from other means than digital advertisers. It takes a person with the understanding of how these processes work.” Yahoo’s gearing up to report its Q3 earnings next week, and time will tell if the company can beef up its premium ad products and revive the lagging display revenues that plagued it last quarter.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Meredith Adopts Native 

Battling falling CPMs and banner blindness, Meredith Corp. is the latest publisher to hop on the native ad bandwagon. The first glimpse of sponsored content will surface later this month via FitnessMagazine.com, which relaunches Wednesday. According to Meredith SVP and Chief Digital Officer Andy Wilson, the publisher’s writers could get a crack at producing branded content. “We’re continuing to look at what involvement we have from the editorial side,” Wilson said. “We’re keeping an open mind.” Meredith will roll out the native spots across its top 10 sites, including Better Homes and Gardens, Allrecipes.com and Parents. The publication has yet to name participating advertisers. Digiday has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00c09Q0WBDP0L0A00> . 

Yahoo Ad Tech 

Yahoo sits on a boatload of cash from the Alibaba IPO, and it needs to do something with it. Purchasing an ad tech company to make it competitive (hopefully) with the likes of Google, Facebook and AOL would be a good start. Then again, Yahoo’s had a lot of starts in ad tech, and has consistently hit the wall well before the finish. The WSJ’s Mike Shields examines Yahoo’s struggles with the ad tech tools it’s already rolled out, now bundled under the Yahoo Advertising banner. As VivaKi exec Sean Kegelman points out, Yahoo has a lot of holes to fill: “They are just playing catch up in display, and they are nowhere in video. They need help in mobile too. There are a whole bunch of components of their stack where they need to either build or buy. It’s indicative that they are still far behind.” Read it (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PCB00000AQ4Dq02cWa0> . 

Mobile Video Mediation 

Mobile’s hot, video’s hot, but what about mobile video? “Mobile video mediation platform” and stealth startup Aerserv revealed itself to the world Monday via VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPcb4B00W000qAQ0020ADD> . Basically, the technology is designed to let publishers prioritize which ad networks fill their available mobile video ad slots. In the words of company CEO Josh Speyer: “Mediation just means that we allow publishers to take how they sell, who they sell to, and what the ad formats are, and govern the risk and reward of additional monetization.” Ad mediation isn’t altogether exotic - MoPub, now owned by Twitter, has offered it as a free value-add since 2012 - so Aerserv seems to be differentiating via its focus on mobile video. 

The Oracle Of Business Data 

On Wednesday, Oracle and B2B intent data provider Madison Logic partnered to make more than 100 million anonymous business profiles available to advertisers. “B2B marketers have long relied on marketing automation and sales efforts to reach their target audience but they are missing a huge opportunity to continue that dialogue across paid media," said Oracle Data Cloud VP Peter De Temmerman in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0cAAE0DcQ00> . Madison Logic VP of programmatic data solutions Greg Herbst will lead the Oracle partnership.

eBay’s Q3 Earnings 

Still experiencing minor aftershocks from its cybersecurity breach back in May, eBay reported a 12% increase in Q3 revenue to roughly $4.4 billion, and a small uptick in mobile-enabled commerce volume from $62 billion last quarter <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4Q0F0P00qD002LBW0dAc>  to $63 billion in Q3, up 27%. (Earnings release PDF <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0QA0DB0We2Lq00cA00G4P0> .) eBay and PayPal both generated double-digit customer growth, reaching 157 million active registered accounts and 152 million active buyers, respectively. Though there was no mention of eBay’s mobile ad network (announced  <http://go.adexchanger.com/AQ0H04WB200AcPq00L0f0DA> in September, with an expected Q4 launch), there was talk of how Apple Pay will impact the overall business.

CPG On TV 

Simulmedia is licensing Nielsen Catalina Solutions’ marketing platform, AdVantics On Demand, with the aim of upping reach and sales for Simulmedia CPG TV ad clients. Nielsen Catalina Solutions CEO Mike Nazzaro said the partnership signals a shift to behavior-based TV planning. "This will help drive a critical focus on sales results and create more opportunity for TV to have a major effect on advertiser goals,” he added.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

The Other Search War 

Bing put up a good fight, but Google Chairman Eric Schmidt says the company’s biggest rival in the search arena is Amazon. "People don't think of Amazon as search, but if you are looking for something to buy, you are more often than not looking for it on Amazon,” Schmidt said during a speech in Berlin on Monday. “They’re obviously more focused on the commerce side of the equation, but, at their roots, they are answering users' questions and searches, just as we are.” Read on via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000c2040qAcLPDBIS0WA0> . 

Snapchatter 

Recent reports of Snapchat’s plunge into advertising may have been exaggerated. In a piece on the company’s platform ambitions, The Information notes, “The forthcoming ads—and recent tests—are part of a strategy used by Snapchat’s founders during its ongoing mega-funding round to prove to potential investors that, if they wanted, the app could monetize its millions of users in that way.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00IT0ALAWPdcB02q000>  

Selling Yahoo 

Yahoo has nabbed Kevin Gentzel, former chief revenue officer at The Washington Post, to run ad sales. The stakes are high, as Mike Shields reports for the WSJ. “Mr. Gentzel, who will report to Yahoo’s head of Americas Ned Brody, is now taking on one of the more high-pressured jobs in online advertising. Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has spent the last few years radically remaking the company, and that makeover has yet to pay off in ad revenue growth.” Job one: package native! More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLIWU0APce020qD40>  

Aereo Buzzer Shot 

Though the Supreme Court ordered Internet broadcasting company Aereo to halt operations in July for infringing on copyright, the company – or what’s left of it – is still fighting. CEO Chet Kanoji is asking the FCC to change the definition of a video provider. He writes in a blog post, “We believe that clarifying the [multichannel video program distributor] definition to narrowly include linear online video services like Aereo's would have clear benefits to consumers, creators and distributors alike."

*	October 22: Webcast and Analyst Q <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0cHA0q0t0BAL0PDC2> &A on Picking the Right Programmatic Media Management Model with Joanna O'Connell
*	Data-Driven Thinking column...News Outlets Need Native Ads, Not Paywalls by Ted Dhanik, engage:BDR <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00c0uC0WIDP0L0A00>  "Unless a news source has the resources to develop multiple subscription services, paywall revenue can’t grow or even offset losses in ad revenue because a model based on saving the best information and experiences for paid subscribers will inevitably drive away unpaid users, who have too many free, ad-supported alternatives..."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Automating Local TV Sales 

WideOrbit is supporting a new “live environment” for trading locally sold, linear TV. The offering was created in partnership with IPG’s MAGNA GLOBAL and Tribune Media and includes “linear television station inventory across customized geographic areas ranging from specific DMA footprints to total US coverage,” according to a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0QL0000CP02BAqDc0C40A> . WideOrbit acquired Admeta in July <http://go.adexchanger.com/lCBqR000LcDP0A2A4000D0W>  and put two of its top executives <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40E0A2C0BSLD0WcP00q0A0>  in charge of programmatic sales and product. 

Salesforce Cloudburst 

CRM stalwart Salesforce.com will unveil an analytics product dubbed Wave during its Dreamforce show this week in San Francisco. The offering builds on Salesforce.com’s earlier acquisitions of data visualization and BI tools RelateIQ and EdgeSpring. Salesforce.com has a habit of buying companies and rebranding them into new “clouds.” With its latest, it’s inviting stronger comparison to SAP and IBM on business intelligence. “With Wave, companies can spot links between business units,” according to Bloomberg <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0CA0DB0WF2Lq00cA00T4P0> . But what about its implications for marketers? More details on the ground at Dreamforce. 

Valuing Big Data 

How much is that big data that's swirling in your enterprise worth? A lot, a whole heckuva lot – or nothing. It all depends on what you’re doing with it, says The Wall Street Journal. Companies such as Kroger, no doubt with help from its partner Dunnhumby, are highlighted among those making money off of big data (related comic <http://go.adexchanger.com/uG0000DB4L0A0U02CPqWAc0> ). Gartner analyst Douglas Laney estimates Kroger makes $100 million a year in data sales alone. Read it (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000C2Hc0L0B0VA4PDAq> . 

Pub, Agency Cozy Up 

In a tie-up between The Huffington Post and Leo Burnett, HuffPo’s in-house creative team (called HuffPost Partner Studio) will strategize with the Leo Burnett guys. Leo Burnett also gets first dibs on The Huffington Post’s social media data. So far, only a “select group” of Leo Burnett clients are participating. Those that do get to distribute their advertising content across both The Huffington Post and other publishing assets owned by its parent company, AOL. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0ICcWPW0A00> . 

Online Sports Videos Grow with WWE Network 

Advertisers in search of premium online video, like Pepsi, Mattel and Kmart, have signed on to stream ads on the WWE network. The wrestling-focused content gives advertisers the opportunity to reach young males, a demographic that can be difficult for advertisers to find. The ads will appear between content, not interrupt it. Users pay for the live, pay-per-view and archived wrestling videos, to the tune of $9.99 a month. By comparison, Hulu Plus’ limited advertising model has attracted 6 million subscribers who pay $7.99 a month. The WWE network says it signed up 700,000 subscribers in the first four months of launch and expects a million by the end of the year.

Apple Pay, Attribution Hub? 

Apple is moving fast with plans to replace cash and credit card transaction with its own solution baked into the iPhone. MacRumors reports that Walgreens support for Apple Pay kicks off on Saturday.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Mobile Dimes 

In a recent interview with Bloomberg News <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqsP04A0LB0WAy02c0000iD> , Vice CEO Shane Smith called mobile “the holy grail” for media companies. “Mobile is the Wild West,” Smith said. “It's where everyone's scale is coming from, but it's very difficult to monetize right now." New York Business Journal reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00c0jy0WtDP0L0A00>  that mobile ad spend will jump 83% to hit $18 billion this year, but will only account for about 10% of marketers’ overall budgets. With more time spent on mobile, Biz Journal reporter Ben Fischer writes, “Closing that gap is a crucial goal for any media company, in particular one targeting a young, international audience like Vice.” 

Video In Hand 

Video sellers struggle to squeeze revenue from mobile as much as display sellers do. BrightRoll COO Bruce Falck told Beet.TV, “Measurement hasn’t quite caught up. In other words, there’s a lot more supply in the mobile space than is currently being transacted. That gets fixed in 2015. We’re going to see a big uptick in mobile video spend driven by improvements in measurements.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0kcA00uyD0AP00040> . That is, if Atlas, Google and other deterministic ID solutions live up to their promise. 

Voter Audience 

Targeted video ads are hot stuff for political operatives, but guaranteed ad space in swing states is hard to come by. The New York Times reports, “Already, there is almost no remaining YouTube inventory for reserve buys — the ads that cannot be skipped — in Alaska, Maine, Montana and New Hampshire, and inventory is increasingly tight in nearly a dozen other competitive states.” RTB is a scatter market of sorts. More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0cvA0q0l0BAL0PDy2>  

Sizing Sizmek 

In a preliminary Q3 outlook, Sizmek warned of lower revenue on reduced demand for its rich media product. The downbeat result follows a disappointing Q2 with "lower-than-expected" growth in North America and Asia. It's interesting to note the parallel with Conversant. Both companies built their ad tech stacks, stabilized in early 2014, and then failed to accelerate sufficiently in subsequent quarters. Conversant found its sugar daddy with Alliance Data Systems <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40m0A2y0BwLD0WcP00q0A0> , but Sizmek looks to still be struggling. Andy Ellenthal, EVP global sales, is leaving the company. Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPcn0yq0AD00B4x020W0>  

Wary Of Automation 

Execs from Telefonica and Visa Europe voiced lingering concerns about programmatic at the Association of Online Publishers’ conference. “With programmatic the risk is that it goes somewhere we don’t want it to,” said Telefonica’s head of social media, Paul Fabretti, “Content creators get the risk.” Visa Europe senior digital communications exec Andy Donaldson shared similar hesitancies specific to automating within social. “The advent of social has made it more necessary to think on our feet and be more reactive,” Donaldson said. “The idea of automating any of that still rings alarm bells with me. … If you automate something, especially in the social space, you’re in trouble because if people spot automation it falls flat on its face.” More via  <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40o0A2y0ByLD0WcP00q0A0> The Drum.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Ephemeral Ads 

Though valued at a whopping $10 billion, Snapchat has yet to raise revenue. But that’s about to change, according to Bloomberg <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0c0LWD0L4PP0A2q0s0BA00> . Speaking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco on Wednesday, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel confirmed, “People are going to see the first ads on Snapchat soon.” Ads will be… “optional.” In somewhat related news, WSJ reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0s0P4qA02000WLM0Q0AcDB>  that Vessel, a soon-to-come online video service founded by former Hulu CEO Jason Kilar, is also courting advertisers. It’s autumn, and monetization is in the air. 

Boutique Holding Companies 

Small to mid-sized agency holding companies are trending, Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PRBND000qA2s04L0c> , and attracting the attention of private equity firms. ”Our thesis is that pre- and post- the Omnicom-Publicis merger and lack of completion, there's a real opportunity to create a middle-market player in the space," said Terry Graunke, co-founder of Lake Capital, once such company. He added, “The world is begging for content, specifically digital content.” 

Install M&A 

AppLovin grabbed German-based mobile ad network Moboqo on Thursday for an undisclosed sum. AppLovin works with developers to expand its install base, and its gross revenue has surpassed a $100 million run rate, according to TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/gO0D40L0q20cBA0AW000SsP> . The acquisition was driven by a hunt for talent, as AppLovin won’t be adopting Moboqo’s technology, which CEO Adam Foroughi described as “similar and smaller scale.” Germany will be AppLovin’s first European hub, with offices to come in London. 

Videoplaza Unwraps Programmatic Tools 

London-based video ad-management and serving platform Videoplaza unveiled its programmatic trading platform, which the company has named Konnect. “Videoplaza is dead serious about making programmatic trading work for the premium side of the market who is today not served by the ecosystem,” said CEO Sorosh Tavakoli. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00PWqA000cPsA0T040D2L> . 

Tech Halo 

Interbrand’s yearly Best Global Brands report <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0QcA00UsD0AP00040>  surfaced on Thursday and, according to the ranking, tech giants are on top. Apple ranked first, followed by Google. Tech brands are stepping into their golden age, according to Interbrand Global CEO Jez Frampton, but data security and behavioral data mining for marketing purposes could lessen their velocity.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Native In The Exchange 

Twitter's MoPub unwrapped some features to ease native ad operations for developers, courtesy of the June  <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0cUA0q0X0BAL0PDl2> acquisition of Namo Media. Keek, a social app, is one MoPub client seeing increased ad revenue and user engagement thanks to the tweaks. ”Being able to change the ad targeting and ad location without any app updates means we can experiment with ad placements and ad load without interrupting the user experience,” said Keek’s SVP of monetization, Bill Blummer. “With a few clicks, we can see how our ad revenue and user engagement is affected immediately.” Twitter blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0l0P4qA02000WLY0V0AcDB> . 

Imagine All The Beacons 

In a think piece via StreetFight Mag <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0Zl0Lc0DB0W0W0q4P20A0A> , Opera Mediaworks’ Andrew Dubatowka blue-skies the future of beacon tech. Though real-time tracking and messaging is a opportunity for marketers, writes Dubatowka, “An even more interesting advertising use case than in-store alerts is using advanced beacon data to hyper-target an audience across a broad set of mobile apps and sites, times of day and contexts. Finding that fitness addict when he is watching sports highlights, or reaching a loyal customer while she is checking the news are what we should be getting excited about.” Physical retargeting.

Flooding The Eurozone 

Publicis-owned agency Starcom Mediavest Group and data analytics firm Acxiom to jointly scale their data offerings in Europe. The Drum reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0cYA0q000BAL0PDm2> , “The partnership has been formed in response to increasing client demand to connect consumer insight and targeting generated from their existing offline CRM programmes with online media planning and buying.” Chris Camacho, Managing Partner at SMG, said the partnership will enhance audience identification and targeting capabilities, and “expand beyond this into the world of programmatic buying.” Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/iZmW00BcP1L00A000Dq2A04> . 

Forbes Reworks Native 

On Wednesday, Forbes unveiled a native ad strategy overhaul with tweaks to its BrandVoice pages. “We were hearing [brand clients’] challenges,” Forbes CRO Mark Howard told Digiday. “That they were going to the effort of creating all this content, and the pieces were getting published there, but then that was pretty much the extent of that.” Now, Forbes clients like NetApp and PayPal will have greater say over how their content is presented. Brands will be able prioritize the placement of certain posts, and organize other sponsored content under topical tabs. The new native protocols are slated to surface on Oct. 14.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Atlas Jitters 

Publishers are nervous about data leaking through codes and scripts on their properties, including Facebook’s “social hooks.” According to The Information, that nervousness may have extended to the company’s recently rebuilt ad server <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0ah0Lc0DB030W0q4P20A0A> . “In an abundance of caution, publishers are taking a ‘wait-and-see’ approach for more evidence that using Atlas would help them make more money,“ the story claims. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/FcDBL00b40W0P2hq000AA04>  (sub required) It’s not clear from the piece that publishers are rejecting Atlas tags, or just withholding their names from Facebook’s publicity machine. Certainly it’s an overstatement that “no major Web publisher” will work with Atlas. Google itself has certified Atlas <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0c50B4L0c2AAP00q0Dh00>  on its exchange and its owned and operated properties for a while now. 

Ignorance Not Excused 

IAB VP Mike Zaneis tells Ad Age that “[b]ig changes are coming folks. Everyone will have obligations, everybody is going to have to make changes." What those obligations and changes are, exactly, have yet to come to light. But the implication is that pleading the fifth on buying fraudulent traffic will not be tolerated in the (near?) future. “Too many people are engaging in acts of omission,” Zaneis added. “That's not going to be okay anymore.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/T60Wh0P0c000DBd20L4qAA0> . But details are still sketchy on what the IAB, ANA and 4As have planned for their anti-fraud task force. 

Merging For Automation 

Digital exchange company Zenovia snapped up programmatic SSP (was an ad server back in the day) AdJuggler to “improve industry efficiency by directly connecting buyers and sellers of programmatic digital media.” Zenovia founder Dwight Ringdahl claimed in the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/ychWDqP00A0LABe04700020>  that as a result of investing in AdJuggler, publishers will see higher CPMs and buyers will find improved campaign yields. Recall that back in March Zenovia bought assets of Australian DSP Brandscreen <http://go.adexchanger.com/qcAW0A0DL8004h02B0Pf00q> . Programmatic consolidation marches on! 

Geotargeting For All 

Facebook’s ad biz creeps toward location approximation with the rollout of “local awareness ads.” The offering is an audience discovery function baked into Facebook’s “Ads Create” tool. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00c0gh0W9DP0L0A00>  on Tuesday, the company said, “Our conversations with advertisers have shown that when it comes to driving in-store sales, an ad’s reach is far more important than the engagement it receives (things such as clicks, comments or likes).” US businesses can add age, gender and location filters into their Facebook ads, but users must opt in for tracking. 

Agencies Assemble 

MDC Partners sister agencies Assembly and Doner Media struck a partnership on Tuesday. In a press release, Assembly CEO Martin Cass explained, “Assembly is operating under a new model that delivers the most progressive thinking and solutions to help brands thrive in today's media environment. By bringing Doner Media's robust local media buying and sophisticated retail expertise into our offering, we are now even better equipped to optimize marketers' media investments and deliver unique business-building programs for clients across categories."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Display Media 2019 

Forrester says US display advertising will grow from $19.8 billion this year to $37.6 billion in 2019. The report, authored by analyst Samantha Merlivat, also project that video advertising will account for 55% of all online display ad revenue in five years, and exchange-based programmatic will drive nearly 40% of total spend on desktop display. But Forrester cautions, “Ad fraud and viewability loom large. Marketers will increasingly turn to programmatic direct and private marketplaces to have more control over the placement of high-value display inventory. This will be particularly true for video.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0cbA0q0o0BAL0PDb2> . 

Physical Pixels 

DOOH media company Titan installed roughly 500 tracking beacons in Manhattan phone booths last year, BuzzFeed reveals. The beacons are manufactured by location-based targeting company Gimbal, and use Bluetooth connections to track the movements of people around the city. “In its current iteration, a Gimbal beacon requires a third-party app to trigger advertisements, and requires those apps to receive ‘opt-in’ permission from users in order to collect data and send notifications.” Shortly after publishing its report, BuzzFeed says the city asked for the beacons’ removal.

Budget Migration 

Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, the CEO of Omnicom Group’s media operations, Daryl Simm, advised marketers to move 10 to 25% of TV ad spend to online video. “I do think we have hit the apex and we are moving into an environment where there is more talent – actors, directors, producers and brands – wanting to enter the online video space,” Simm said. “That holds a lot of promise for online video.” However! “The amount of quality online video is still an issue,” and “The desire for more measurement and accountability is getting higher and higher.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqdP04A0LB0WAb02c0000qD>

But “[a]ny advertising built around the health initiatives would not be as targeted as it could be on television or other media,” according to Reuters <http://go.adexchanger.com/O060P4qA02000WLJ0r0AcDB> . “Pharmaceutical companies, for instance, are prohibited from using Facebook to promote the sale of prescription drugs, in part because of concerns surrounding disclosures.” According to three unnamed sources, Facebook is still in the “idea-gathering” stage and declined to comment. 

Privacy Values 

Brooklyn artist Risa Puno asked 380 New Yorkers to fork over a range of PII in exchange for a cookie. A “staggeringly high” percentage of participants ponied up home address, driver’s license number, phone number, partial social security numbers and more. ProPublica has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/is6W00BcPKL00A000Dq2A04>  on the “highly unscientific but delicious” experiment. 

WhatsApp Go-Ahead 

European Union regulators gave the thumbs-up to Facebook’s $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, which was hotly contested by telecom corporations in Europe. “The regulator ultimately decided that Facebook’s control over consumers’ data wouldn’t harm competition in the online advertising market, and that privacy-related concerns fell outside its remit,” reports the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D006L0ALAWPtcB02q000> . Unlike Google, Facebook still has tailwinds in Europe. 

Early Days Of Automation 

Programmatic was the big buzzword during NYC’s Advertising Week, but widespread automation of media buys is still nascent. “The efficiency of automating the buy/sell process and creating an ‘efficient market’ argument is theoretically solid, but has not yet been achieved in practice,” wrote Ace Metrix CEO Peter Daboll in a Friday column via Forbes <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pcu00q2M06> . “There are well-documented issues with transparency and ‘value-stealing’ from the intermediaries.”

Netflix’s senior manager of programmatic buying, Kathy O'Dowd, says protecting data is a big reason for in-house programmatic. “There's a lot of intellectual property that we want to keep internal. And that's made a lot easier when we're internal," she disclosed during a panel in Advertising Week in NYC, as reported by Ad Age's Alex Kantrowitz. Kellogg’s insights and analytics director, Aaron Fetters, agreed: “We've learned a lot about the value and power of first-party data.” O’Dowd and Fetters jointly pointed to a need for internal collaboration when taking programmatic in-house, and said agencies continue to play a crucial role.

'Hundreds Of These Platforms' 

Investors are glum about the outcomes of recent ad tech IPOs, but Merkle CEO David Williams isn’t worried. Speaking to Fortune, he said, “Valuation has clearly been a problem here in the ad tech space. Some of these companies really entered the market too early, while some are really just products.” But he added that the long-term value of new players has yet to be seen. “Within the decade there is going to be hundreds of these platforms,” Williams posited. “From a marketing perspective, it will be a whole new world to figure out the value of these individual platforms but more importantly how you understand the value across platforms.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DcBqA0020P0WSA1v00> . 

There Will Be Likes 

TechCrunch reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PwB00000A14Dq02cWT0>  that Facebook is extending its “like” button to mobile devices, and the functionality is now available to third-party Android and iOS developers for apps of all shapes and sizes. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000x2040qAcLPDB1U0WA0> , Facebook explained, “People using a mobile app can directly Like the app's Facebook Page, or any Open Graph object within the app, and share on Facebook. The mobile Like Button works seamlessly with the Facebook account the person is logged into on [sic] their device, allowing people to Like any piece of content, while in your native app.” A new signal for the app marketer. 

Google: Let’s Get Physical 

Google’s making a bet on the Internet of Things with The Physical Web, an initiative that aims to enable connected devices in the wild – think bus-stop kiosks, vending machines, movie posters, parking meters – to communicate with smartphones sans apps. Need to know what time your bus is scheduled to arrive? Just walk up to the bus stop. It’ll tell you. As the project’s website <http://go.adexchanger.com/FcDBL00Vy0W0P21q000AA04>  notes: “Everything should be just a tap away.” Cool. But a question for Google: What do you plan to do with the data?

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Quantcast Buys DCO 

Quantcast has added retargeting and dynamic creative technology with the acquisition of UK-based Struq for an undisclosed sum. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0bF0B4L072AAP00q0DX00> , Struq CEO Sam Barnett explained, “Combining Quantcast’s unrivaled data about online user behavior with our ad personalization technology will lead to a deeper understanding of users and enable us to more effectively personalize an ad to them.” Though the companies seemingly have different missions (Quantcast’s focus has historically been to provide data on Internet traffic while Struq’s main goal is ad personalization), the pairing makes a lot of sense in light of Quantcast’s “ad effectiveness” capabilities <http://go.adexchanger.com/o028000GX00bPW04DABAqL0>  and its ad targeting business <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0bHA0000q0D920LAWX> . 

Sprechen Sie Data? 

Google’s European woes continue with a legal ruling in Hamburg that could impact ad data collection. The New York Times reports, “Google must seek Germans’ expressed permission before it uses their data to create online user profiles across its services like email, online search and its Android-based mobile products.” Failure to obtain that opt-in could expose the company to a hefty $1.27 million ($1 million euro) fine. Google has a month to respond. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0bIA0q0a0BAL0PDX2> . 

Dueling Desks 

Rubicon Project released some video clips from its Trading Desk panel in  <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWb400J0ABD00X0bL02P0Aq> Cannes, featuring Xaxis’ Brian Lesser, VivaKi’s Stephan Beringer, Accuen’s Josh Jacobs and IPG Mediabrands’ Arun Kumar. As you may recall from AdExchanger’s previously published transcript <http://go.adexchanger.com/AX0K04WB200AbPq00L0c0DA> , there were fireworks. Lesser to Beringer: “Maurice [Levy] said he’ll never be a principal in a media transaction. We don’t agree with that. Xaxis is not an agency. We never have been an agency. We’re a platform and we feel the business model is justified by the performance. We do not get bought if we feel the prices are too high or if we do not perform.” Go here <http://go.adexchanger.com/AX0K04WB200AbPq00L0c0DA>  for AdExchanger’s full transcript from June. 

Pushy Tie-Up 

Urban Airship and beacon tech company Gimbal have paired up to support more granular data in the "push" environment. The companies can snatch details as specific as where the user is in a store, total time spent in-store, the user’s last visit and purchase history. Urban Airship CMO Brent Hieggelke said, “We’re defining what we call the ‘in the moment opportunity.’ But it’s actually beyond that. It’s in the moment, it’s at the moment and it’s sparking new moments.” Oh, the moments. <http://go.adexchanger.com/TL0WX0P0b000DBd20L4qAA0>

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Spinning Off PayPal’s Data 

How will eBay’s spinoff of PayPal, announced Tuesday, impact the companies’ joint efforts on ads? eBay bought location-based media company Where.com in 2011 and rolled it into the modern-day PayPal Media Network and weeks ago unveiled plans to scale up and launch an eBay Mobile Ad Network (AdExchanger story <http://go.adexchanger.com/gx0D40L0q20bBA0AW0000SP> ). A PayPal spokesman tells AdExchanger, “net-net, nothing changes right now. This process will take a year to fully separate, and right now we’re focused on our customers as we move forward.” Amazon expert and author Brad Stone, speaking at the Shop.org Summi in Seattle, said “Amazon offers payment as a service and has deeply established the links between payments and commerce. … eBay is now unwinding those synergies. It feels to me, frankly, like a defeat.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/lSBq1000LbDP0A2A4000y0W> . 

Affiperf: ‘Meta DSP’ 

Havas has been in-market with its Affiperf trading desk for a while now, but the platform has apparently been re-envisioned as a “meta DSP” capable of bidding across multiple demand-side platforms through one point of contact. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPbz4B00W000qAS0020A2D> . Dominique Delport, global managing director of Havas Media Group, said in a statement, “The explosion of data and the significant rise in the number of DSPs on the market has meant that [the] promise of programmatic was lost to complexity and silos. Affiperf Meta DSP disrupts the market with the creation of one single tool that enables our clients to optimise choice across multiple platforms.” 

LatAm Comes Online 

Latin America is new to programmatically traded media, but it’s full of white space. So says Maria Méndez, who leads global markets for IPG’s Mediabrands Audience Platform, in a piece for MyersBizNet. Mendez tells Jay Sears that MAP’s Cadreon trading desk will manage $2.5 million in spend across the region this year, up from about $800,000 in 2013 (which equals 300% growth). And, by 2016, the percentage of the holding company’s Latin American spend on programmatic will be “at least 30% of overall media. Programmatic is here to stay.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0b3A0q0A0BAL0PDS2> . 

Fraud Show Of Force 

On Tuesday, the IAB, the ANA and 4A’s launched a jointly controlled effort to operationalize anti-fraud measures. “Self-regulation is only as strong as the accountability program that ensures its implementation, and all of our trade groups’ resources are required in order to guarantee this new compliance organization’s ability to eradicate criminal activity,” said Nancy Hill, president and CEO of 4A’s. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DbBqA0020P0WBAS400> . 

FTC Under The Hood 

Speaking on data collection during Advertising Week in NYC, Federal Trade Commissioner Julie Brill tells Ad Age, “This ecosystem is becoming really complicated.” Her proposed solution: better choice mechanisms expressed through consumer data dashboards. “Consumers will have more transparency with respect to what kind of information is being used when profiles are created about them, so that they can decide whether or not to suppress that information being used for marketing. … More privacy and data security protections need to be built under the hood.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/AS0504WB200AbPq00L0C0DA> .
