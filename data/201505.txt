 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Addressable TV Growth Spurt 

Programmatic TV will draw $10 billion in spend by 2019, according to data from IPG Mediabrands’ Magna Global. That will represent an approximate tripling from $3.5 billion, or 4% of US TV budgets, this year. “It's nascent and can only grow from here," Magna Global’s EVP of global forecasting, Vincent Letang, told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0EA0DB0WV2Lq00qA00p4P0> . Letang said household addressability is about to take off as more MSOs activate targeting on set-top boxes. 

Mobile Reality Check 

Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Mike Shields challenges Mary Meeker’s assumption that mobile ad revenues will catch up with user growth. “Many advertisers – particularly those focused on brand-focused campaigns – haven’t necessarily bought into mobile as [an] effective ad medium.” What if it’s not about reallocating, but “right-sizing”? Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02W000qE00qPW04DABAqL0>  

Time For Change 

Time and other publications are tinkering with their paywall, subscription and membership practices in an effort to remain viable as their print businesses recede. Time erected a paywall on Entertainment Weekly last month and aims to spread that to other publications in its stable this summer, according to Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0XEqWPr0A00> . An important note is that Time “is looking as much to the registration data as the hard cash it hopes to shake out of consumers.” After reading 10 articles, visitors will have to submit their email addresses and preferences in order to continue, first-party data that Time suspects advertisers will covet. 

The Price Of Loyalty 

Mobile marketing costs keep growing, according to Fiksu’s data. The app marketing platform says its cost per loyal user hit $2.74 in April, an 80% jump YoY. “While April represented another expensive month for mobile, it's also an example of the heightened focus on strategic mobile spending by leading brands," said Fiksu CEO Micah Adler.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Meeker Trends 

She’s back! Former Morgan Stanley analyst Mary Meeker, who is now in a similar capacity at venture firm Kleiner Perkins, delivered her annual Internet Trends report at the Code conference <http://go.adexchanger.com/FqDBL00Uj0W0P2zq000AA04> . Get the slides <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4z0k0P00qD002LBW0VAq> . Meeker says that of the $50 billion in total US Internet ad spend in 2014, $13 billion was in mobile with a $25 billion potential opportunity ahead in mobile if growth continues at its current clip. 

That’s Entertainment 

Continuing with the stats, eMarketer says digital ad spend in the media and entertainment industries will hit a combined $6.2 billion in 2015, jumping 19% YoY. But advertisers in those industries have been slow to adopt programmatic. Programmatic ad spend from the entertainment industry will total $780 million in 2015 – that’s 41% of the overall display ad investment. Meanwhile media brands will spend $620 million programmatically, or 38% of its display spending. However, “Media and entertainment industries have been pretty aggressive with mobile,” said AOL’s director of mobile, Chad Gallagher. “They’ve realized that consumers are on mobile devices more and more, especially at home.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000l2040qAqLPDBzW0WA0> . 

Twitter Bubbles Up Audience Data 

A new Twitter tool dubbed “audience insight” will offer brands and users more information on potential audiences, including purchase history, TV viewing and consumer patterns pulled from previous Twitter use. “Based on this information, you can identify the best segments to target within Twitter Ads, along with which creative – such as a Vine or video clip – your audience will find most compelling.” Read the  <http://go.adexchanger.com/GqB0Az20Dm4XW0AL0000P0q> blog post. 

German Court: Thumbs-Up To Shakedowns 

AdBlock Plus is now two for two in German courts. On Wednesday the company won a suit brought against its Acceptable Ads Initiative (AAI). The AAI is a white list kept by AdBlock Plus that lets the company greenlight publishers that meet its acceptability requirements (and pay a fee) to circumvent ad blocking. The Drum reporter Seb Joseph points out <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0YqA00nzD0AP00040>  that the policy doesn’t have an anticompetitive market effect “because users choose to install the software and ... it is not yet big enough to have a negligible impact on the money they make from ads.” This comes a month after courts ruled against a group of German publishers who tried to ban ad-blocking software plug-ins from their websites. More on the FT (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/uZ0000DB4L0A0o02zPqWAq0> . 

Chasing The Ears 

TargetSpot will use Nielsen’s PRIZM data to improve audience segmentation for streaming audio ads. Streaming audio consumption suffers from fragmentation, and advertisers are scrambling to follow consumers across the sprawling channels and devices where people do their listening. “By mapping consumer and psychographic data to the household level, PRIZM allows us to create interest-based campaigns at a scale which was previously not possible,” said David Kert, TargetSpot COO.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Re/Vox 

In the 12 hours since it came to light that Vox Media will buy Re/code, the deal has sparked innumerable hot takes in tech and media circles. Is it about the conference business? Or Re/code's outsized influence in tech? Or perhaps a sign of “turmoil” in tech blogging, as The New York Times would have it <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0ev0Lq0DB0z0W0q4P20A0A> ? Whatever the reasons, the acquisition provides another window into Vox’s growth strategy in the wake of its $48 million round in November at a $380 million valuation and its earlier snap-up of the Curbed network of sites. CEO Jim Bankoff told the Times’ Sydney Ember these acquisitions are part of an “ambitious plan to create a kind of Time Inc. for the digital age, with a portfolio of publications that appeal to a wide swath of viewers.” Read Re/code’s announcement <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0vA0DB0Wf2Lq00qA00A4P0> . 

Advancing NBC 

Not one to be left in the programmatic TV dust, NBCUniversal is the latest to snag an advanced ads exec. Maxifier CEO Denise Colella will now lead advanced advertising products and strategy for NBCUniversal’s advertising sales division, including the development of data-enabled ad products like the Audience Targeting Platform. Fox Networks Group recently appointed true[x] CEO Joe Marchese <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00gWqA000qPvA0B040D2L>  to lead advanced ads while ABC snagged Videology’s Mike Dean <http://go.adexchanger.com/gh0D40L0q20qBA0AW000CvP>  for a data-driven sales role. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PDB00000Av4Dq02qWi0> . 

Snapchat’s Road Map 

Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel opens up to Bloomberg about the long game to monetize the popular app and, spoiler alert, it leans heavily on advertising. The firm, which has grown to a staff of 330 and a valuation north of $15 billion in three years, is circulating a 23-page sales pitch to ad agencies this month touting its selling points. In its pitch, the company claims that 60% of 13- to 34-year-old American smartphone users are active on Snapchat and consume a combined 2 billion videos per day. “A lot of people look at Internet advertising as a tax on the system,” Spiegel said. “That’s sort of discouraging if you care about making new products and especially discouraging if you feel like you can solve problems.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pj40v0DEAqq2> . 

Mobile’s Mobilization 

Despite the rise in mobile device usage, there’s no sign yet that mobile audience numbers are cannibalizing desktop, the WSJ reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/uk0000DB4L0A0F02vPqWAq0> . “The key thing to remember is that percentages are not zero-sum,” said Chartbeat CEO Tony Haile. “You can have mobile growing to 50% of your traffic and desktop traffic remaining healthy.” In effect, mobile isn’t eating desktop’s share of the pie, it’s increasing the size of the pie itself. What the post doesn’t address, and is a major focus for global platforms, is the prevalence of mobile phones (often as the sole computer) among users in emerging markets like India and China. 

Mall Trackers 

In-mall mobile trackers and beacon networks are becoming more sophisticated, Ad Age  <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0qGA0q0l0BAL0PDv2> reports. Mobiquity is one firm driving the market forward, with devices installed in 240 malls and plans to grow its presence to 290 malls by July. The tech is advanced enough to know where consumers entered the mall and which route was traveled from store to store. Geofencing data isn’t new to marketers, but more precise data is bubbling up from beacons placed in food courts or other areas outside specific stores. The aim, according to Dean Julia, co-CEO of Mobiquity, is to monetize that additional data. “We've spoken to numerous ad networks and they all seem to think that adding that piece of data is extremely valuable and they would be able to upsell on CPM pricing,” Julia said.

Newsletters Reflecting On Newsletters 

Newsletters, once a way to build incremental traffic, are increasingly valued by media companies. Digiday takes a look <http://go.adexchanger.com/Av0I04WB200AqPq00L0n0DA>  at a few newsletters, such as the Quartz Daily Brief and Ozy’s Presidential Daily Brief, that try to make their products consumable beyond the scope of the website. “One of the realities of the digital world is that people aren’t going to consume content on your site,” said Aneesh Raman, VP at Ozy. Despite the fact that subscription numbers can be relatively low, “Newsletters are opt-in, and subscribers tend to be loyalists, which can make them an attractive place for advertisers to be.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Only A Flesh Wound 

The agency bloodletting continues. A Sony spokeswoman confirmed to Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pqu00q2i0m>  that its $600 million-plus media account with Interpublic Group’s Mediabrands is under review, and J&J has done the same <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0qv0B4L0j2AAP00q0Dm00>  with its $2.6 billion account. “It's gotten so busy on the review front that the question agencies have is which top marketing spenders are not putting their business up for bid this year,” wrote Ad Age reporter Alexandra Bruell. P&G, Unilever, L’Oreal, Coca-Cola and 21st Century Fox are among some of the biggest advertisers in the world, and all have cut ties with or consolidated their media accounts in recent months. Agencies have kept a tight lid on the topic. (Ad Age cites no in-agency sources, even anonymously.) 

Another Cable Mega-Merger 

Charter Communications is near a deal to buy Time Warner Cable for $55 billion or so, several outlets reported on Memorial Day. The bid comes in the wake of TWC’s failed merger with Comcast, which didn’t pass muster with regulators. “Dealmaking is heating up in an industry facing waning demand for traditional pay-TV packages and competition from Netflix, Amazon and other online services,” writes Bloomberg. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40k0A2m0BwLD0WqP00q0A0>  For ad tech observers, ISPs and telcos are being freshly noticed as a new class of M <http://go.adexchanger.com/qqAW0A0DLx004m02B0Pl00q> &A “strategics” in the wake of the AOL-Verizon deal. 

Spotify’s Video Fantasy 

The Drum asked a bunch of media execs about Spotify’s move into video, and what it could mean for brands. Gian LaVecchia, MEC North America’s digital content marketing lead, sees an opportunity to deliver video programming based on user data and insights. But "audio, in the most general terms, is a lean-back experience vs. video which is clearly a more actively engaged lean-forward behavior,” he said. “As a result, it may take some time to scale video consumption behaviors across Spotify's PC and mobile platforms.” Bear in mind that Spotify has a ways to go to scale its audience to the likes of Facebook or Pandora. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lmm2yADP0q00A0> . 

EU Watchdog Growls At Facebook Plugins 

A German state-backed consumer watchdog group sued two ecommerce companies because of the transmission of user data through Facebook’s "like" button, continuing the European nation’s prominence as the sharp edge of the regulatory fight against ad platform powerhouses. The suit is relevant beyond the involved ecommerce companies, as Facebook’s social plugins, which include code implemented on other websites, are under increasing scrutiny <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00z0nL0mW00AD2q0qA04>  across the EU. Politico has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/GqB0Am20DA4oW0AL0000P0q> . 

The Great Unbundling 

Last year, HP unveiled plans to split the corporation in two in order to stay abreast of the digital ecosystem. Other firms have adopted similar strategies (such as Symantec’s Veritas spinoff and eBay cutting away from PayPal). But as tech firms unbundle in a fight for their lives, there’s a price to pay. Reporting its earnings late last week, HP disclosed the spinoff would cost billions of dollars. That just might be the cost of survival, according to FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives, “especially as these large traditional IT stalwarts are finding themselves stuck or in neutral, or even reverse,” Ives told the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLmWp0APqB020qD40> . “It really is a precedent-setting for what a lot of these other tech companies might do over the next 12 to 18 months.”

Salesforce Playing Very, Very Hard To Get 

CNBC reported on Friday <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0qD0B4L0r2AAP00q0Dm00>  that a supposed suitor for Salesforce.com was, as suspected, Microsoft. Microsoft offered as much as $55 billion, which would have been the biggest software acquisition of all time (by a lot). But Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was reportedly holding out for $70 billion. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who’s had the gig less than 18 months, was apparently “somewhat reluctant to pull the trigger on a deal of such size and consequence.” Salesforce stock is up nearly 10% since Bloomberg reported the rumored sale.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Social's Sisyphus 

Twitter “hand-holds” advertisers more than any other social media company, writes Bloomberg Business reporter Sarah Frier, but doesn’t have much to show for the strategy. Agencies invest far more in both Facebook and Google, while Twitter takes less than 1% of the $145 billion digital ad market in the US, according to eMarketer. The reasons are known: Twitter’s user base remains relatively small, and its data-tracking and measurement tools are not as advanced as on platforms. “They’re working very hard, but it’s difficult to justify continued spending and prove its impact, because it’s still kind of small,” said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. “The efforts of the sales team have gotten Twitter a seat at the table. But it might be the kids’ table.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00fz0ALAWPEqB02q000> . 

Google’s Shoppable Dreams 

Though popular, YouTube still hasn’t made Google much money. To fix that, the firm is diving deeper into ecommerce by adding shoppable elements to its TrueView offering (YouTube’s skippable pre-roll spots). WSJ reporter Alistair Barr points out <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PA40f0DFAqq2>  that the addition may be less about commerce than it is an attempt to demonstrate YouTube’s utility. Advertisers such as furniture retailer Wayfair and cosmetics vendor Sephora are already testing the offering, and Wayfair claims the ads generated three times as much revenue as unaltered TrueView ads. Separate but related: The WSJ reports on a Google claim that data from its new store can better connect real-world purchases to ads shoppers saw on smartphones, which the firm says should up mobile spend. More on that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0qAAG0DBf00>  

The State Of PII 

Americans are increasingly mistrustful about their privacy online, according to data from Pew Research, and online advertisers are the biggest perceived offenders. Seventy-six percent of US adults are “not too confident” or “not at all confident” that information collected by online advertisers will remain private and secure, according to the data. And 69% are similarly concerned about how their data is collected and used by social media sites. The research details that though many Americans have taken more steps to protect their online identities, much of the backlash is in response to government surveillance, not advertising. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/iHfW00BqPCL00A000Dq2A04> . 

What The Algorithm Wants, The Algorithm Gets 

Google recently made news when it adjusted its algorithm to reward publications with higher mobile site quality, but what “quality” specifically means remains vague. Writing for The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PIB00000Af4Dq02qWD0> , Stuart Long, SEO lead at Stickyeyes, says the company has observed “a distinct correlation between a number of different website quality signals and how well a website performs in Google’s SERPs.” Mobile site speed appears to be a rising factor in negative search display, as is a site’s ability to retain viewers for a longer time.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

All Alibaba’s Data 

Alibaba, known mostly for ecommerce, actually makes most of its revenue from advertising. Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWb4qA008L0PB072>  that Alibaba’s online marketing arm, Alimama, “has teamed up with four first-wave agency partners: WPP's OgilvyOne China, Omnicom Group's Nim Digital, Dentsu Inc.'s &C and independent player Hylink. Alibaba combines a massive base of shoppers and first-party user data with data from things like online videos and smartphone map access. Jacco ter Schegget, president of OgilvyOne China, says of Alibaba’s data that “there's nothing comparable in the West in terms of breadth and scope." Agencies are licking their chops to tap the exploding Chinese ecommerce market on behalf of their primarily western clients. 

Salesforce.com Marketing Clout 

Salesforce.com’s Marketing Cloud had a rosy fiscal first quarter, with a 29% increase in revenue year-over-year to $143.2 million. Vice chairman Keith Block, speaking on the earnings call, called the company’s marketing tools, underpinned by the ExactTarget acquisition, the “tip of the spear” for Salesforce.com in its dealings with B2C clients. “The Marketing Cloud is coming up in every conversation we have now with senior marketers. People are voting with their dollars. ” Read the full results <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00P9DbA40LqB008A> .

Mobile Browser Ad Blocking 

Adblock Plus launched a mobile browser on Wednesday, built by automatically including Adblock Plus in the open-source Firefox browser. For now consumers can only get it on Android. According to community manager Ben Williams, the Adblock Browser will exit beta in July or August, and may include additional tracking and malware protection. Until now, Adblock Plus was difficult to install on mobile, VentureBeat notes, but it’s also hard to drive installs for a standalone mobile browser, as Mozilla and Opera can attest. The mobile revolution: sand in the ad-blocking fuel tank? More <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB009WqA000qPbA0a040D2L> . The debut comes amid reports that mobile carriers in the EU will turn on massive ad-blocking features. More on that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0abqWPb0A00>  

Cross-Platform Proof 

In an attempt to make sense of how continued media fragmentation is affecting ad reach, Nielsen used its Total Ad Ratings to score the effectiveness of 12 campaigns across TV and desktop. Results proved (unsurprisingly) that a cross-platform targeting approach reaches larger audiences than either screen can independently achieve. On average, the campaigns reached 10.4% more people by including digital spots, and reached almost 75% of the target audience. “TV alone reached over two-thirds of the desired audience,” Nielsen wrote in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBc000Abq0A200WL4qPb00> . “While this is significant, it still was improved upon with the addition of online which contributed 7.7% of reach that was not achieved with TV alone.” 

Marketing Tech For Tech Marketers 

IDG Communications announced ABM360, a set of tools purpose-built for B2B tech campaigns. The offering combines the first-party data IDG pulls from outlets like CIO, MacWorld, GamePro and TechHive with its lead-gen and marketing services. According to CEO Michael Friedenberger, “[Our] expertise led us to create a suite of ABM products that specifically helps technology marketers identify company purchasing behavior and the people driving these decisions.” Read the full release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00q0cb0WdDP0L0A00> .

Facebook now provides free Shutterstock images to anyone buying advertisements on its platform, and will even give multiple free images for every ad unit, automatically testing them to shift dollars to what is working best..."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

CPGs And Retailers FTW 

Retailers are slated to spend more than other sectors on digital advertising this year, shelling out $12.9 billion, or 20% of a $58.6 billion pie, according to eMarketer. Financial, telecom and CPG will take third, fourth and fifth place, respectively. Read more. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bq00pW2A0000404B0DvLPqA>  CPGs are big adopters of programmatic, with 63% of display ads forecast to be purchased programmatically this year. 

No Cookie, No Cry 

The Network Advertising Initiative, the trade org for ad networks that has been somewhat subsumed into the Digital Advertising Alliance, has issued some guidelines for non-cookie tracking technologies – such as probabilistic device IDs from companies like Drawbridge and TapAd.  “Members must tell their publishing partners – that is, the operators of Web sites where data is collected – to notify consumers about non-cookie tracking technology,” Mediapost reports. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DW44qA00qL0PB0w2>  

Pandora Intel 

Pandora is acquiring Next Big Sound, a firm that offers online music analytics, for an undisclosed sum. Next Big Sound’s tech will benefit brands advertising on Pandora by identifying artists to partner with, and measuring the impact of those partnerships. The buy will build on Pandora’s current data efforts, like its Artist Marketing Platform and Artist Audio Messaging. The data it brings will also be rolled into Pandora’s insights on music preferences, patterns and trends generated by its 80 million monthly active users. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00L4x2rADP0q00A0> . 

Apple, With A Grain Of Salt 

It seems the well-hashed rumors of Apple’s potential – some even thought inevitable – entrance into the home TV market can be put to rest (even as its TV service plans remain on track). Quartz rounded up <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ts0W40P0q000DBy20L4qAA0>  some reports and predictions, including one Piper Jaffray analyst who says “we no longer expect a television to launch indefinitely.” Carl Icahn, a vocal Apple shareholder, evidently was expecting <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pqt00q2z04>  an expansion into TV devices. Related: Gene Munster, another analyst who’s been forecasting an eventual an Apple TV set, now sees Apple as being five years off from a virtual reality breakthrough.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Inside The Google Batcave 

Ad Age reporter Alex Kantrowitz details the inner workings of Google’s anti-fraud team. The 100-person unit is led by Douglas de Jager, previously the founder of anti-fraud firm Spider.io, which Google bought last year. Until now, little was known about the particulars of the unit, or how exactly Google is battling botnets and fraud. Though the tech giant stands to lose the most to fraud, it is also in a position to lead the forces of good. According to the piece, Google is primed to share more of its data. “Mr. de Jager said his team is about to start publishing detailed information on bad traffic for the first time, providing … details on certain botnets it detects," Kantrowitz writes. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0UWD0Lp000B4000pG> . 

CPM To CPH 

The Financial Times rolled out a time-based ad metric on Monday called cost per hour (CPH), which aims to quell viewability and placement concerns that come with click-based measurement. “While CPM values every impression the same, CPH uses time to measure value,” said FT’s ad sales director, Dominic Good. “The FT has shown through extensive testing that brand familiarity and recollection among readers increases significantly the longer an ad is in view. Adverts seen for five seconds or more on FT.com show up to 50% higher brand recall and familiarity than ads that are visible for a shorter period of time.” The FT worked with Chartbeat to develop the metric, and an early group of 10 clients (including BP, iShares and IBM) generated more than $1 million in incremental revenue.

Defending TV's Turf 

As TV, OTT and digital video converge, the media companies that comprise the Cable Advertising Bureau (CAB) have shuttered the organization in favor of a more expansive org. The new group, the Video Advertising Bureau (VAB), is “a bigger, brawnier organization comprising 110 broadcast and cable networks and the 11 largest MVPDs,” Adweek reports. Sean Cunningham, who was CEO of CAB and holds the same position at VAB, said the change “accelerates our ability to view meaningful research and develop analytics." Digital video, your move. Read on via Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PrDUA40LpB00IA> . 

OTT Explosion 

Speaking of the television wars, data from Juniper Research out Monday suggests subscriber volume for service like Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime Instant Video will total 333.2 million globally by 2019, up from 92.1 million in 2014. According to the report, VOD ad spend will grow nearly four-fold by 2019, and China is slated to surpass North America as the dominant marketplace. “The threat from OTT services has notably forced Verizon’s hand into bundling cheaper packages, minus sports channels,” reads the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWJ400s0ABD00U0pL02P0Aq> . “Meanwhile, OTT players continue to strengthen their market position.” TechCrunch has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00KWqA000pPUA0t040D2L> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Mobile Ads No More? 

And you thought viewability <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0p0A0000q0Dp20LAWM>  was the big mobile issue of the day? If the Financial Times’ anonymous European telco source is correct, mobile operators might take the nuclear option  <http://go.adexchanger.com/GpB0AM20D74wW0AL0000P0q> and detonate all mobile ads from their networks. (In-feed ads from Facebook and Twitter will be unscathed.) The real target, of course, is Google, which is investing and banking big <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0p00Mq8x>  on mobile revenue. The end game, according to the FT’s source, is to drag Google kicking and screaming to the negotiating table so the carriers can catch more coin. Of course, those telcos could very well be poking a dragon that – let’s be honest – is already wide awake <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000M2yp0L0B09A4PDAq>  regarding the competitive threat it poses: “The executive … acknowledged that targeting Google could be risky from both a legal and public relations perspective.”

In a move that pits it against marketplace powerhouses like Amazon and eBay, Google will roll out a ‘Buy Button’ on certain mobile search queries, as reported by the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/qpAW0A0DLa004M02B0Pz00q> . The user, even after clicking on a product, will remain on Google’s property (as opposed to the current system, where a user is sent to a retailer’s site and Google takes a cut). “To mollify retailers’ concerns ... Retailers will get address information and likely email addresses for future marketing efforts.” The product pages will also be heavily branded by the retailer. The move is mobile-focused, making up for the fact that more people search on mobile, but that mobile ads are less expensive and less effective for sales. 

Viewable Corn Flakes 

Speaking at the Digiday Programmatic Summit in Austin late last week, Kellogg’s senior manager of paid digital media spelled out his company’s approach to programmatic and viewability. “We’re not just asking for viewability because we read it in an article at some point; we kind of wrote the book for ourselves internally. Every additional 5% of viewability drives X number ROI,” he said. “And that’s why we hold it so dear and so true – because we’ve seen the difference.” More via Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0ApA00bMD0AP00040> . 

Man Vs. Mobile Machine 

Bot detection firm Distill Networks claims that only 41% of  web traffic comes from humans. In a report last week, it said that “bad bots” drive 22% of all Internet traffic, smaller websites are most at risk and digital publishers as a whole host 32% of all bot traffic. “For the first time in history, mobile bad bot traffic makes up a significant portion of overall bad bot traffic, having increased tenfold over the past year,” said Distil Networks CEO Rami Essaid. “Mobile bots make up less than 10% of the total bots, creating a greenfield of opportunity for the bad bot landscape to more than double very quickly.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0p00MqcB> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Social Consolidation 

Social marketing software company Brand Networks snapped up rival SHIFT for $50 million on Thursday. It’s the second notable social advertising acquisition for Brand, which bought Optimal for $35 million about 18 months ago. All three companies got their starts as Facebook PMD companies and have expanded to Twitter and LinkedIn. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/AE0a04WB200ApPq00L0H0DA> . SHIFT had raised $14 million, according to CrunchBase. The combined company claims to power more than $500 million in social ad spend for roughly 650 brands and agencies. “Marketers can now use a single platform to break down the walls between disparate teams, data silos and content types to deliver relevant content across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn,” said CEO Jamie Tedford. “Together with SHIFT, we're able to deliver on the promise of making marketing more relevant to consumers and more effective for marketers.” Read AdEXchanger’s 2012  <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0p00EqbI> Q&A with Tedford. 

The Public Eye  

“Suddenly, everyone wants a piece of programmatic advertising – whatever that is,” writes The Street’s deputy managing director, Leon Lazaroff, responding to Verizon’s pending acquisition of AOL. Lazaroff cites Rocket Fuel, Rubicon Project and Millennial Media, all of which have either been on recent hot streaks (Rubicon up 7.4% over two days, Millennial Media up 4.3% in one) or surged on AOL’s news. TubeMogul, still recovering from a 30-point tumble in February, bounced back 8.4% on Tuesday. AOL, for its part, took an 18% leap. Programmatic is here to stay.

Leviathan 

With 18 months still to go before the election, political ad buyers are already exerting major influence over digital and TV media. As reported by National Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqdP04A0LB0WAE02p0000KD> , early primary states are seeing media booked months in advance, with key outlets already running out of inventory. Some real estate, like Facebook and YouTube video ads, can’t be reserved ahead of time, but “the price is just expected to rise.” A flood of deep-pocketed Super PACs and campaigns may wreak havoc on the auction-based digital ad world, and platforms like Google and Facebook may have to weigh consumer annoyance with political adverts against the high prices campaigners are willing to pay.  

DCO 2.0 

Jivox claims a new tool called Dynamic Canvas takes dynamic creative optimization (DCO) to the next level. Speaking to VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqeP04A0LB0WAE02p0000LD> , CEO Diaz Nesamoney says traditional DCO lets advertisers create up to several dozen variations of an ad and serve those spots to categories of consumers. According to Nesamoney, Dynamic Canvas created about 3,000 ad variations in a test for Jack Daniel’s Whiskey and targeted at the individual level, not by category. Companies like DoubleClick and Sizmek have similar offerings, but Nesamoney was quick to call that tech a retrofit. “If you tried to code the Jack Daniel’s [ad in a rich media platform], it’s impossible,” Nesamoney said. “They’re missing a CMS [content management system to handle the assets], a decisioning engine, and integration with data.” 

OTT And Beyond 

Writing for HBR <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0pfA0000q0DM20LAWE> , Janet Balis, principal at EY Advisory, spells out the challenge for brands in an OTT future. As brands like Bonobos make the jump from brick-and-mortar to digital storefronts, scale is the biggest hurdle. “Most traditional advertising is a one-time exposure of a brand message to a consumer,” Balis explains. “The higher calling is to focus on brand exposures that allow brands to talk to a customer on an ongoing basis. OTT demands that brands reconfigure their relationships with media companies, agencies, and third-party data platforms. But brands will also have to look internally to rethink the way they themselves organize and operate.”

Brick-And-Mortar’s Attribution Boost 

A tie-up between MarketShare and Acxiom will use LiveRamp’s data and MarketShare’s analytics platform to link offline purchases with a brand’s digital advertising. The aim is to optimize digital marketing towards brick-and-mortar sales. “We’re providing clear guidance to retail brands on how to thread the needle – to give digital marketing the credit it’s due for driving sales in-store, and to optimize digital spend for offline impact going forward,” William Merchan, SVP of strategic alliances for MarketShare, told AdExchanger. “Connecting the dots between touch points that don’t connect directly is a serious challenge for retailers.” Serious challenges for retailers mean opportunity for ad tech.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

TV Turning To DMPs 

Turner debuted a DMP, the Turner Data Cloud, which it likens to Amazon’s targeting service. The WSJ reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0pjA0q0V0BAL0PDz2>  that Turner wants to tap its cross-channel properties, “getting data pulled from information on folks who have shared stories via social media from CNN.com or downloaded games from Adult Swim.” Turner was careful to note that a marketer’s own data or the “services that are widely used” will be compatible. The new product aims to surface richer audience data and will use those insights to guide programming decisions. 

Cross-Device Ca$h 

Tapad announced <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0pk0B4L0W2AAP00q0Dz00>  $18.5 million in funding on Wednesday, bringing the cross-device platform’s total funding to $36 million. The round was led by a smorgasbord of investors – among them Blue Cloud Ventures, Avalon Ventures, FirstMark Capital, Silicon Valley Bank and others – who don’t seem bothered by the oft-cited ad tech bubble. Tapad plans to spend its cash on selling more licenses to its Device Graph and to expand its product offering, including a forthcoming linear TV measurement tool that CEO Are Traasdahl called, “a natural extension of our product road map.” 

Ad Blocking Evolves 

An Israeli startup called Shine could pose a threat to mobile advertising with its ad-blocking tech, Business Insider  <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWz4pA00lL0PB0X2> reports. Claiming it’s backed by some major wireless carriers, Shine argues that mobile ads cost users 10-15% of data plans, deplete battery life and decrease load times. But not all are worried. “Some consumers will pay or find other ways to opt out of advertising, but this will not impact this growth of mobile advertising which is set to become the majority of global digital advertising spend,” said Stephen Upstone, CEO of video ad tech firm LoopMe. Shine will white-label its offering and license it to mobile carriers, who will decide how its consumers can implement the software. 

Scaling The Podcast (Or Not) 

Though podcast listening in the US is growing and numbers nearly 50 million people age 13 and older per month, according to Edison Research, the pool of sponsors hasn’t diversified. The Atlantic reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWz4pA00mL0PB0Y2>  that Squarespace, Stamps.com, Audible and MailChimp are podcasts’ most frequent advertisers. “I can't imagine, especially for larger brands, that there's going to be much advertising interest in shows other than the ones that are really big and impactful, like Serial and similar shows," said MailChimp’s marketing director, Mark DiCristina. One deterrent is that an ad on popular podcasts can carry a $25 to $40 CPM. That’s two to three times what terrestrial radio costs. 

Bots On Video 

As video advertising gains share, it’s getting more attention from fraudsters. To thwart their efforts Videology has partnered with White Ops, which provides technology to identify and block online bots. One key benefit White Ops offers is the ability to “[differentiate] human vs. bot browsing even from the same compromised machine,” preventing a baby/bathwater problem.

App Install Boom 

Opera Mediaworks reported revenues of $83.2 million for Q1 2015, a notable 162% jump since last year. The US-based mobile ad subsidiary of Opera Software attributed the spike to growing revenue in part to app-install revenue from the gaming sector. “For the rest of 2015, we will continue to focus on some key efforts such as mobile video, native advertising, premium programmatic offerings, and on growing our user acquisition and brand advertising business globally,” said CEO Mahi de Silva in blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00q01L0AW00AD2q0pA04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google’s Growing Dominance 

The gap between Google’s media revenue and the revenue of its competitors is growing, according to a report from ZenithOptimedia. The Publicis agency estimates that Google is 136% bigger than the world’s second-largest media owner, Disney, up from 115% a year ago. Still not impressed? Google’s media revenue is so huge it dwarfs the media revenue of Disney and the third-largest media owner, Comcast, put together. “The top digital media owners currently maintain a strong grip on the digital ad market, but they face the constant threat of displacement by disruptive innovators,” said Jonathan Barnard, ZenithOptimedia’s head of forecasting. “While some emerging-market media owners face challenges in expanding their businesses in the short term, we expect to see more media owners from emerging markets enter the top 30 over the next few years.” More via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0pXA0000q0DG20LAWs> . 

Rubicon Eyes Long-Tail 

Rubicon continued its programmatic direct chorus with the roll-out of a self-serve platform for publishers. “Self-Serve helps these sellers scale their sales operations, where otherwise they are constrained [or] limited to focusing on the largest deals,” Kaylie Smith, Rubicon’s head of seller cloud, told MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000Y2040qApLPDBsH0WA0> . “It’s also invaluable to smaller or startup sellers that may not have the funds to hire a sales force, and seek to automate their entire ad sales effort.” The tech will be available to both digital publishers and mobile app developers. The release follows Rubicon’s Guaranteed Orders platform debut two months ago. AdExchanger story. <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40I0A2s0BZLD0WpP00q0A0>  

B2B, Bouncing Back 

B2B media revenue climbed $27.6 billion in 2014, a 3.3% increase from 2013, according to a report released by the Business Information Network. Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/As0004WB200ApPq00L0J0DA>  points out that B2B media has bounced back from the severe revenue dropoff precipitated by the global recession in 2008. Events still account for a plurality of total revenue, representing approximately $12.2 billion. However, the fastest-growing sectors are digital advertising and data services. Print remains an underwater anchor, dropping from 36% of total industry revenue in 2008 to 24% six years later. 

In-App Viewability 

Millennial Media and Integral Ad Science partnered to offer a 100% viewability guarantee for in-app mobile ad campaigns, Adweek reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP0010KL0sW00AD2q0pA04> . “The responsibility of viewability falls on us all,” commented Shenan Reed, president of digital in North America for MEC. “Brands, agencies, publishers, ad tech vendors, and industry organizations all need to work together to push this forward and create industry-wide adoption.” Read the  <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0L202q0L0AB0Dp00As4> press release. The news comes one day after ad tech firm 33Across made a similar promise – to deliver 100% viewable, fraud-free ads, or advertisers get their money back. More on that via VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW03L0000sP02BAqDp0M40A> . 

DSP For Small Biz 

Digital ad platform Centro unveiled a DSP offering aimed at brands and agencies with smaller budgets that are often constrained by minimum spend requirements. The platform comes 18 months after Centro's acquisition of DSP SiteScout and will include first-party device ID integration, GPS targeting capabilities and private marketplace discovery and execution. “The trend to bring programmatic ‘in-house’ is irrefutable, but the gaps in resources – be that headcount or skill set – loom large, especially in this market segment,” Centro CMO Kelly Wenzel told AdExchanger.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Cadreon Does TV   

IPG-owned Cadreon and TubeMogul have paired up to build TV targeting tools for ad delivery across networks. Cadreon will draw proprietary data from its Audience Measurement Platform as well as from set-top boxes and other consumer shopping sources in order to serve targeted TV ads. “This enables us to take our data, sync it with other data sources and do it far more efficiently than we have to date,” Cadreon’s global president, Arun Kumar, told the WSJ. But Kumar was quick to clarify that Cadreon isn’t building the equivalent of a TV trading desk. “We take no position on inventory ... We don’t do arbitrage.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40y0A2k0BHLD0WpP00q0A0> . With the Upfronts percolating, it’s TV day over at the WSJ. Read its two other stories on the changing world <http://go.adexchanger.com/FpDBL00zI0W0P2kq000AA04>  confronting linear television powerhouses <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0p0AWD0L4PJ0A2q0k0BA00> . 

More Tremors In Agency-Land 

The world’s premier advertisers are looking to more channels and partners than ever before. Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/uB0000DB4L0A0K02kPqWAp0>  that Frito-Lay has followed brands like Best Buy and Mondelez International by ditching the agency-of-record model in favor of accepting RFPs on a project basis. Frito-Lay North America CMO Ram Krishnan said, "The way we look at it is: Who is the best-suited for what we are trying to do with the consumer and the message?" Citing internal and external marketing groups, PR firms, video production houses and social media managers that increasingly tread in the same pool, Krishnan doesn’t see a need for a single brand “custodian” anymore. 

Uber For Advertising 

DOOH is coming to ridesharing, Business Insider reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/uC0000DB4L0A0L02kPqWAp0> , as start-ups like Viewswagen work with drivers to place advertising screens in cars. For a driver, it’s low-hanging fruit, and some deals could be offered based on a rider’s known destination. But Uber is proceeding with caution. The company, which is separately being sued <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWD400M0ABD00k0pL02P0Aq>  by a group of drivers, discourages the use of its DOOH screen for ads (for now, at least). Uber must balance the modest pay raise – “Viewswagen estimated drivers for services like Uber and Lyft could earn about $3 more per hour if they signed up to the service.” – with potential rider dissatisfaction. 

Certifiably Analytical 

A new certification program from the IAB will help aspiring marketers pass muster in data analytics, managing data supply sources and creating “data products,” among other skills. “This IAB program will address the change in skills required to operate in this new digital media environment,” said IAB EVP and COO Patrick Dolan in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0kA0DB0WE2Lq00pA00N4P0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

No. 3 In Ad Tech? 

AOL is working hard to differentiate itself from other ad tech providers. On Friday, Business Insider cited <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0CepWPF0A00>  a recent remark by CEO Tim Armstrong that “AOL believes it will soon become a credible No. 3” behind Google and Facebook. The new ideal for top platforms is the ability to provide end-to-end service, from early media planning straight through to providing post-campaign optimization insights. It remains to be seen, though, if an open platform can compete with the most prominent walled gardens. AOL has a ways to go before it can credibly put itself in that category, as it controls 0.71% of the digital ad market, compared to Facebook’s 9.07% and Google’s 31.07%. 

Snappy Ads 

Snapchat is switching up its ad pricing with the launch of Two Pennies, a 10-second ad format priced at 2 cents per view. The offering lives inside Snapchat Discover, the in-app news hub with content from CNN, ESPN, Vice, People and Daily Mail, among others. Though Snapchat has yet to clarify what constitutes a viewed ad, some of its partners are already sold. "I think it's transformative," said Daily Mail NA CEO and former BuzzFeed President Jon Steinberg, adding, “We are ready to sell that immediately.” Snapchat unveiled the offering at the Daily Mail/Elite Daily Digital Content NewFront presentation late last week. Read on via Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PGB00000Ae4Dq02pWD0> . 

Levien’s Digital Dreams 

Under sales chief Meredith Levien, The New York Times is making more inventory available programmatically and prepping ad products that can live outside its walls, Lucia Moses writes for Digiday. But despite recent gains in digital, print still contributes a whopping 70% of revenue. “We want to get it right,” Levien told Digiday. “I think we’re maybe taking our time more than others are to get it right. And I think we’re pretty comfortable with where we are.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00eE0ALAWPHpB02q000> . 

In Theatres Now 

Screenvision tied up with mobile engagement platform Sito Mobile to bring real-time audience targeting to the big screen. Through the partnership, a retailer advertising in theaters could serve a coupon to mobile devices in the theater. In a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqIB0p2LW004D0P0AAF0e00> , the firm calls the project “A natural cross-screen extension for advertisers to maintain their engagement with cinema audiences after they have left the theater, with the cinema ad still fresh and top-of-mind.” MediaPost has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWe4pA00JL0PB0G2> . 

Anti-Fraud Collab 

Programmatic player Digilant, once the trading desk arm of Havas, will use pre-bid fraud screening technology from Integral Ad Science. “Programmatic advertising is an increasingly critical part of all of our media campaigns. The challenge is keeping brand safety a top priority in an automated world,” said Kim Riedell, Digilant’s SVP of product and marketing. Riedell added that the partnership with Integral Ad Science signaled the firm’s steps to combat viewability and fraud.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Local Behemoth On The Block 

Yelp is exploring a sale, according to The Wall Street Journal’s sources. Needham & Co. analyst Kerry Rice tells Bloomberg possible buyers include Google, Yahoo, Facebook or travel firms like Priceline and TripAdvisor. “They’ve done a great job building out local advertising and weaving together the small and medium business market, which is a really hard market to be successful in,” Rice said. “I think it’s going to have to be a hefty premium considering how high their stock price has been.” With a $3.3 billion market cap, that means Yelp could go for as much as $3.5 billion.

Grilling Bots 

Speaking to Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02h000d700pPW04DABAqL0> , DoubleVerify CEO Wayne Gattinella describes how bots are getting more sophisticated. “Bots do things that make them look human. In the spring, they golf, they grill, they garden, they visit sites that make them appear like a consumer,” he said. The clear challenge is identifying fraudsters during their brief 48- to 72-hour life cycles, even though by the time many hit the sales funnel, “they have all the characteristics of a very high-value, potentially responsive consumer.” 

The Smallest Screen 

The Apple Watch has been on the market for a couple of weeks – so now it’s time to start measuring. Yahoo, Localytics and Fiksu <http://go.adexchanger.com/Te0W70P0p000DBi20L4qAA0>  all released Apple Watch analytics this week to track user behavior on what Brad Jones, director of product management for Flurry analytics at Yahoo, called “the smallest screen.” Yahoo’s offering will include info on new and active users, daily events, user behavior and engagement. The diminutive screen size and consumer expectation around quick, seamless experiences means that “developers will be testing heavily and data is essential to understanding what works,” Jones told AdExchanger. There are more than 3,000 apps available on the Apple Watch thus far. Jones declined to share how many of those are in the Flurry community. 9to5Mac has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000072jp0L0B0fA4PDAq> . 

TV’s Dating Game 

At the National Cable Telecommunications Association’s annual show, a panel of CEOs from firms Cablevision, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and Liberty Global touched on M&A buzz in the sector. Facing pressure from digital companies creeping onto their turf, from Wi-Fi networks to OTT entertainment, many of the “mid-tier” players are pushing to consolidate. “I’m not sure if I got asked out on a date or to get married,” responded Time Warner CEO Rob Marcus to Cablevision CEO James Dolan’s overtures. “I feel like I’m on Match.com,” said Cox Communications President Pat Esser. “I feel like we’re all trying to update our relationship status right now.” Read the full WSJ article <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A470g0P00qD002LBW0kAp> . 

Facebook Goes Deeper 

Developers are now able to create deep links for their mobile app install ads on Facebook. The move is an extension of Facebook’s existing support for mobile app re-engagement ads. The functionality seems fairly run of the mill. When users tap on a mobile app install ad, developers will be able to direct them to specific places in their apps – a product page, for example – rather than the home page. “Removing extra steps between clicking the ad and getting to [an] offer provides a more seamless customer experience,” wrote Facebook engineering manager John Ketchpaw on the company’s developer  <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0l70Lp0DB0h0W0q4P20A0A> blog.

Brick-And-Mortar Fights Back 

Two of America’s most venerated retailers, the 114-year-old Nordstrom and 157-year-old Macy’s, are seen as benchmarks in retail’s shift to digital. Digiday reporter Hilary Milnes compares the efforts <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWo400k0ABD0070pL02P0Aq>  of both brands and highlights how department stores are competing against online powerhouses like Amazon. Initiatives like shoppable Instagram accounts and the adoption of point-of-sale bells and whistles, like Apple Pay and in-app transactions, drive more returns than “sexier” social media initiatives. 

Video Spotting

Spotify is gearing up to launch a video streaming service. Business Insider first reported the rumor in March, and anonymous sources confirmed the news to the Financial Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Ppl00q2p07>  on Thursday. Spotify hosts 60 million subscribers, only 15 million of whom pay to avoid ads. Affording to FT, Spotify’s video-streaming service will look less like a Hulu or Netflix model, and will instead support the firm’s music services. The competition goes both ways, apparently, as Apple keeps its head down on a long-rumored audio platform expected to surface in June.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Reddit’s O&O 

The Verge reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/f002A0L0D200pB2qW0ATP04>  that Reddit is dipping into original video, where it can “control the conversation around the marketing and also tap into more lucrative advertising formats.” The videos will initially focus on the company’s AMA brand, the best loved of Reddit’s offerings, but “after that it will look to bring stories from users and forums to life.” This comes after last year’s $50 million investment and push to mature into a company with monetizable services. Reddit reaches some 170 million monthly users and generated 6.7 billion page views in January. 

Krux Of the Matter 

Krux announced <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DpBqA0020P0W3A2U00>  Wednesday that it’s hooking up with mobile ad platform JUICE Mobile to bring publisher audience segments into Nectar, JUICE’s mobile programmatic direct platform. The partnership solves what Neil Sweeney, JUICE mobile’s CEO, called a “structural challenge” in mobile programmatic today – the prevalence of ad fraud and the lack of guaranteed impressions. The offering is currently in closed beta with several unnamed publishers and trading desks. It’s DMP meets mobile programmatic direct. 

Local Programmatic 

As programmatic and mobile separately command more attention and spend from local advertisers, the two are likely to converge. Referencing April data from Borrell Associates and BIA/Kelsey, eMarketer sees some problems <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0pV0B4L042AAP00q0D200> . They include a lack of experience in “local programmatic” as well as a risk of undermining direct sales relationships. But mobile will be key to local advertisers, according to BIA/Kelsey, whose data forecasts that local mobile ad spend will rise 55.8% in the US this year and grow to $18.2 billion in 2019. 

Havas Q1 

Havas reported $525 million in revenue for Q1 2015, a 20.6% increase YoY. “We start all our pitches with digital, but classic media are still quite strong,” CFO François Laroze told analysts. “The paradox is that we spend more time discussing digital media and spend more money on traditional media." On Wednesday, the holding company also unveiled the assembly of a Greater China cluster to be led by Accenture’s former China managing director, Christophe Cases. Havas posted organic revenue growth of 7.1%, beating out French competitor Publicis’ organic growth rate of 0.9%, and also above the organic growth rates of Omnicom (5.1%), IPG (5.7%) and WPP (5.2%).

Advantage Europe 

The EU released a 16-point plan taking aim at large US tech firms. The Digital Single Market Strategy aims to level the competitive playing field for homegrown telco, commerce and “platform” companies. It goes without saying that ad-supported giants like Facebook and Google are in the crosshairs. These companies “enable consumers to find online information and businesses to exploit the advantages of e-commerce,” reads the European Commission’s final draft <http://go.adexchanger.com/o026000X200pPW04DABAqL0> . US tech giants took little time firing back. “Imposing regulatory barriers would be a grave mistake for Europe, and would have harmful effects on trans-Atlantic trade and investment,” Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, told the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PYD2A40LpB007A> . Looming setback or bluster?

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google’s Mobile Ad Push 

At its AdWords conference on Tuesday, Google debuted new ad formats for mobile. The first, Automobile Ads, gives mobile browsers a carousel of interactive images with added info like horsepower and average gas mileage. The second format, Hotel Ads, aggregates prices, reviews and maps of nearby locations into the mobile ad and offers the option to book rooms on the spot. “Our investments in mobile are driven by consumers’ expectations for immediacy and relevance in the moment,” Google said in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00WJ0ALAWPtoB02q000> . “Based on your feedback and our insights about how people search for information, we’ve built a whole new generation of ad experiences that are richer, more engaging and designed for screen-swipes instead of mouse-clicks so we meet consumers’ needs.” The NYT has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PK40W0DuAoq2> . 

All Atwitter 

Writing for Fusion <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWW4oA00vL0PB0L2> , financial journalist Felix Salmon argues Facebook should buy Twitter. “Twitter would be one more platform for Facebook to sell to advertisers, which could perform in ways that native Facebook ads cannot,” he writes, adding that though Twitter wouldn’t diversify Facebook’s business like WhatsApp or Oculus Rift did, “It would do something more immediately valuable to Facebook’s shareholders: it would diversify Facebook’s revenue streams.” Also consider that MoPub – a more entrenched mobile exchange than LiveRail – could round out the Facebook ad stack. 

Merkle Shops Across The Pond 

Merkle snapped up London-based Periscopix, a performance marketing agency that specializes in search, analytics and programmatic media.The buy will kick off a string of planned international acquisitions, CEO David Williams told AdExchanger. “As Merkle’s clients have become increasingly global, their business needs have evolved, with many looking for a performance marketing partner that is well versed in the use of data, analytics and technology in widely varying markets around the world,” Williams said in an email. “Merkle has begun to pursue a series of international acquisitions which broadens our existing footprint in the UK and China.” Periscopix’s 117-strong team will be rolled into Merkle’s Digital Agency Group, led by EVP Craig Dempster.

TV Becoming VT 

TV networks and advertisers are pushing towards a unified advertising system that rolls linear TV, streaming, DVR and video-on-demand all together. Linda Yaccarino, chairman of advertising sales at NBCUniversal, writes for The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0NoA00xWD0AP00040>  that “major media companies are driving important innovations under the umbrella of VT (video technology).” Yaccarino points out that people migrating to new mediums doesn’t hurt networks, because hit shows still post high numbers and new tech has added nearly a full hour per day to the average American’s entertainment viewing. The biggest hurdle comes in the form of metrics and ROI, she adds, as “there is no universal measurement standard that adequately captures audience size across every possible screen.” 

Measuring Mobile 

The MRC issued its first guidance on what constitutes a mobile viewable ad impression. The standards for online and desktop display standards are in effect (50% of the ad’s pixels in view for at least one second for display and two seconds for video), but “a new wrinkle has been added: ‘Loaded Ads.’” MediaPost reports  <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DOA02000BWW0q4oyLP0A> that if “over 50% of an ad’s pixels were in-view, but [the measurement firm] cannot determine how long they were in-view for, that ad is considered a ‘Loaded Ad’ but not a viewable impression.” Another day, another viewability hitch.The MRC emphasized that more extensive guidance is coming later in the year.

Foursquare, B2B Stack? 

Foursquare debuted two new data repositories on Tuesday, Location Cloud and Places, and both make Foursquare seem more like a B2B data provider than a social platform. The Location Cloud will act as a data repository for Foursquare and its spinoff Swarm, but also for outside partners Twitter and Pinterest – with potentially others to be added. “By aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of smartphone sensor data, businesses can understand consumers, predict behaviors, and identify trends,” Foursquare explained in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00o0QW0WADP0L0A00> .

Today, too much brand budget is left on the table when simple changes can make it go much further..."
*	Pollen VC Helps Devs Mind The Gap – The Funding Gap, That Is <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00YWqA000oPOA0A040D2L>  "By acting as the middleman, Pollen enables ad networks to extend credit to developers who otherwise would have spent less on advertising, while developers don’t have to compromise their user acquisition plans because of credit constraints..."
*	Publishers Push Into Commerce <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0O0P4qA02000WLZ0B0AoDB>  "Another important reason these and other companies are trying to turn their readers into their consumers is the enriched data set that comes along with it.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Serious Pinterest 

Pinterest is slowly opening its gates to developers. Its latest platform release lets developers access the data of pinners who connect their accounts to external apps. As TechCrunch reporter Matthew Lynley points out, intent signals abound. “One project involved shipping recipe data that users have pinned over to Instacart, which users could then use to order ingredients for recipes they were interested in cooking.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB004WqA000oPPA0H040D2L>  The news follows the launch of a marketing partner program and ads API. AdExchanger story. <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PIB00000AP4Dq02oW50>  

DOOH Down Under 

TubeMogul paired up with Site Tour, an ad exchange for out-of-home media that will let TubeMogul clients buy billboard, kiosk and elevator screen ads programmatically in Australia. Site Tour CEO Michael Scruby heralded “a new audience for video advertisers and a new revenue channel for out-of-home media owners.” Despite developments like Xaxis’ fairly recent DOOH programmatic product, DOOH seems to be moving at a crawl. Cadreon Australia is the first TubeMogul client to trial the offering. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLPW60APoJ020qD40> . 

Peeling Back The Onion 

The Onion has plans to become a full-fledged digital media platform with a portfolio of properties and apps. A story in The  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4P0K0P00qD002LBW07Ao> Atlantic describes “plans to spin off several new websites, launch a studio to develop films and TV shows, and possibly, raise money from new investors <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqLB0o2LW004D0P0AA80P00> .” A site redesign follows other publications that have adopted infinite scrolling, larger headlines and flexibility across mobile, desktop and tablet displays. According to Mike McAvoy, president and COO at Onion Inc., “An avalanche of money is waiting for whoever effectively blurs the line between publishing and advertising.” 

Mike Bloomberg Woos The Gray Lady 

Michael Bloomberg has his eye on The New York Times, sources tell Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00o09P0WMDP0L0A00> . “There really is meat on the bones. … From what I understand from management in the company, this is real.” Gasparino calls this a deal that will unfold over many months, even years, so don’t hold your breath. A deal would complete a trifecta of moguls coming to the rescue of growth-challenged news brands, roughly 18 months after John Henry and Jeff Bezos nabbed The Boston Globe and The Washington Post, respectively. A sale could give the Times breathing room as it solves for mobile and viewability. More from AdExchanger. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00o0aP0WNDP0L0A00>  

Apple TV’s Project 

Apple’s pay-TV dreams are on a collision course with the inherent complexities of local and sports TV broadcasting. Jan Dawson, a founder at Jackdaw, writes for Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0oO0B4L0b2AAP00q0DP00>  that “there’s a huge opportunity no company but Apple from outside the traditional pay TV space can likely tap into.” Securing local TV and sports distribution, considered a given by many subscribers, would require a massive, nationwide deal-making campaign from Apple. It’s a tall order, but the road’s been paved by the likes of Dish and DirectTV.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Twitter’s Proof Problem 

Twitter’s having a hard time proving its direct-response ads can drive sales, according to the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqiP04A0LB0WAK02o0000KD> . Though Twitter’s got scale (302 million monthly active users, to be exact), marketers and brands aren’t convinced their ad spend is impacting purchases, and that’s driving some away from the platform. “Most platforms in their early stages struggle with being able to connect the dots between digital actions and actual business,” said 360i CEO Sarah Hofstetter. Twitter defended its ad biz as it reported its weakest revenue growth since going public. “We will always make choices which optimize for advertiser value,” said Richard Alfonsi, Twitter’s VP of global online sales. “That’s why we moved to a model that only charges advertisers for the exact outcome they are looking for.” 

Taking Odds On Salesforce Suitor 

Following news that Salesforce has received merger interest, CNBC takes a look <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0ojA0q0L0BAL0PDK2>  at potential suitors. In terms of who could afford the $50 billion company, “there aren't many in the US that are big enough,” writes reporter Ari Levy. Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and IBM have the market cap, but aren’t viewed as credible suitors. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff spent years at Oracle, and while some analysts see that as a reason why the two companies wouldn’t make a deal, others believe Larry Ellison may want Benioff as a potential heir. Microsoft is also considered a likely candidate, as it looks to dominate cloud computing. Microsoft chief Satya Nadella expanded Microsoft’s existing relationship with Salesforce in December. 

iHeart Programmatic 

In reporting iHeartMedia’s Q1 2015 earnings <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00o0MK0WkDP0L0A00> , management touted a recently launched programmatic solution for digital audio ads. The offering lets advertisers target based on psychographic profiles (linked to music preferences), weather, traffic patterns and purchase behavior. “As we add pricing algorithms, we will not focus on the cheapest price, instead, as Google pioneered, we'll focus on delivering the best value,” said Richard Bressler, iHeartMedia’s COO and CFO. “This is good for the advertisers and good for us.” Revenue during the quarter grew 4% to hit $1.4 billion, though the firm said revenue growth was offset by lower core local broadcast radio ad revenue. 

NYT’s Q1: Still Digital Dimes? 

The New York Times is poised to hit 1 million digital subscribers this summer, CEO Mark Thompson told investors. But Re/code’s Edmund Lee says <http://go.adexchanger.com/uN0000DB4L0A0l02KPqWAo0>  subscription growth is overshadowed by the company’s core challenge. “Despite those gains, the Times’ digital revenues – both circulation and advertising – account for little more than a fifth of the paper’s total sales and won’t in any way come close to making up for its once fat print profits,” he writes. A million online subscribers bring in between $190 million to $200 million for the time. Adding in digital ad revenues, the figure is closer to $400 million. That’s a nice number, but still a shadow of the Times’ $1 billion print business. Read AdExchanger’s coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0omA0000q0DO20LAWK>  of the Q1 report.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

OTT Metrics 

Nielsen is bringing better measurement to Roku’s streaming players and to Roku TV. “We believe all TV will be streamed, and with it all TV advertising,” said Scott Rosenberg, VP of advertising at Roku. “With Nielsen, we’re integrating these capabilities directly into the Roku OS, enabling Roku’s channel publishers and advertisers to measure and transact on the industry’s leading metrics.” Advertisers currently deliver content to consumers on approximately half of Roku’s 250 most-watched channels. The partnership will let advertisers on Roku’s platform access Nielsen’s Digital Ad Ratings to measure, guarantee and report on campaign audience delivery. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0okA0q0Y0BAL0PDy2> . 

Honing Customer Analytics Tools 

With the keynote address at Thursday’s Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0yWD0Ll000B4000oZ>  conference, Google analytics evangelist Justin Cutroni discussed the effort to move beyond metrics that have historically defined digital advertising. Put bluntly, “Last-click should be dead.” But Cutroni also emphasized the shift from “session-based” metrics to a “user-based” model. This means Google – and its ad partners – are less interested in what one Internet session looks like, and more interested in a holistic view of a user’s cross-channel, real-world movement through a marketing and sales funnel. That same perspective also leads brands to the most valuable potential customers (what Google evidently calls “whales”), as advertisers start to better understand where users browse online and how that affects actual purchases. 

Young Brits Fuel Facebook Video Growth 

Facebook continues to tout its total video views, but as advertisers focus on audience over eyeballs, the firm also revealed which content producers are gaining the most traction. Though YouTube benefits from its emerging celebrities, Facebook’s video consumption numbers are exploding. “It seems to be the right time to ask,” writes the WSJ’s Mike Shields <http://go.adexchanger.com/inzW00BoP0L00A000Dq2A04> , “are there Facebook video stars?” Facebook’s top content producers skew heavily international and heavily male, with category leaders like Lad Bible, Sport Bible and Unilad Magazine. BuzzFeed is the only American publication in the top 10, and if you think BuzzFeed is good at pushing viral Facebook videos (they are), bear in mind that its total views per month are 320 million, compared to Lad Bible’s 1.6 billion. 

Podcasts Still Having A ‘Moment’ 

NPR, WNYC and WBEZ hosted the first-ever podcast upfront <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0oL0000zP02BAqDo0140A>  on Wednesday in NYC. “We’ve seen a huge change in the conversations we’re having with agencies,” said Sarah van Mosel, VP of underwriting at WNYC, during a pre-show press conference. Advertisers’ interest in the medium has increased enormously in the last nine months, she added, pointing to new stats from Edison Research. More than half of public radio podcast listeners are likely to purchase a product or service advertised during an episode, according to the research, and that purchase intent is bolstered by trust in public radio’s brand. But measurement issues persist. “Metrics is the challenge we have to overcome,” van Mosel said. “Anyone that’s got skin in this game is working to get that solved.” 

Venting On Marketing Tech 

Writing for Ad  <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0zWD0Lp000B4000o2> Age, EgageSimply CEO Judy Shapiro says the marketing industry’s most essential players – marketers – have been relegated to the fringes of the ad tech trend. Her most cutting critique is on fraud and arbitrage. “Today, $1 in active media spend is reduced by 60% to 80% due to fraud and all the arbitrage players who get a cut – tech platforms, exchanges, buying platforms and the data guys,” she writes.
