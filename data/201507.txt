 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

100% Or Bust 

Sony’s multiplatform video network, Crackle, sealed an upfront deal with GroupM on the strength of a promise over cross-screen viewability, Ad Age reports. Though GroupM is “substantially” growing its investment in Crackle, the agency declined to quantify that growth. Crackle will work with analytics firm Moat to report on how and when viewers interact with ads, and according to GroupM chairman Irwin Gotlieb, the deal is a testament to GroupM’s push for 100% viewability as an industry standard. “We now see progress and have the ability to prioritize media investment with brands like Crackle, who deliver both desired audiences and accountability commensurate to the multimillion dollar investments we make,” Gotlieb said. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/gk0D40L0q20uBA0AW000bXP> . 

The Brand Perspective 

On Procter & Gamble’s earnings call, CFO Jon Moeller updated investors on the company’s previously reported efforts toward “simplifying and reducing [its] number of agency relationships.” With flat organic sales and the company selling off 43 brands in the beauty vertical, P&G is looking to trim the money in play for ad agencies to boost its bottom line. There’s still a significant pot of gold, but far fewer agencies will get to share. More at WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/FuDBL00lc0W0P2Xq000AA04> . 

AT&T Rolls Up Ad Tools 

In the wake of AT&T’s acquisition of DirecTV for $49 billion, AT&T merged its AdWorks TV advertising division with DirecTV’s ad sales arm. The combined offering, called AddressablePlus, blends DirecTV’s addressable TV targeting tools and AT&T’s TV Blueprint solution. “The combination of 12 million addressable DirecTV homes with the 70 million homes in the TV Blueprint audience network puts us in a unique position,” said AT&T AdWorks president Rick Welday in a statement. Comcast, your move. Dallas Business Journal has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000X2mu0L0B0dA4PDAq> . 

Meanwhile, In Moscow 

Russian search giant Yandex reported Q2 revenues of $250.7 million, a 14% jump year over year. Yandex’s total number of ad clients increased 9% sequentially in Q2 and spiked 17% year over year. According to CEO Arkady Volozh, the firm is focused on improving its search ad products, particularly for mobile, and will experiment with new audio ads via its Yandex.Radio streaming service. “Later in Q3, we plan to introduce a new auction mechanism that we expect will increase the quality of traffic we drive to our advertising clients and facilitate the overall growth of online advertising," Volozh said in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000e2040qAuLPDBXn0WA0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook: Goes Great With TV 

Facebook can help TV advertisers extend their reach by targeting millennials, according to March research by Nielsen for Facebook IQ. According to the data, Facebook-only campaigns reached 13.4% of 18-to-24-year-olds in the US, while cross-platform campaigns reached 15.5% of the total target audience. For 25-to-34-year-olds in the US, Facebook-only campaigns reached 10% of target audiences while cross-platform ads reached 14%. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PGBUD000qA2S04L0u> . In related news, Facebook debuted an option for advertisers to buy video using gross rating points. Business Insider has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0S0P4qA02000WLV0H0AuDB> . 

Radius Raises 

Marketing intelligence software startup Radius raised $50 million led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. The startup, founded by Facebook vet Darian Shirazi, cobbles together CRM data, social data and data from partner sources for clients like Staples and Revel Systems. The firm has raised $125 million and has a market cap north of $500 million, according to a spokesperson. ZDNet has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PW40S0DIAuq2> . 

Gannett Reports 

Gannett’s Q2 revenue fell 8.7% to $727 million in the second quarter. But the publisher grew its domestic digital visitors 16% to to 92 million uniques. As for programmatic, management says it’s growing. “We’ve done a fine job with our network in the last few months of leveraging programmatic at a higher rate,” Gannett CEO Robert Dickey told investors. “As a result, we’ve been seeing some significant increases in that particular area.” He added, “We continue to see good local display growth at our domestic properties.” The publisher completed a spinoff from its former parent company, Tegna, in June. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/gX0D40L0q20uBA0AW000JSP> . 

Playing Politics 

The NYT dives into Facebook’s advertising and outreach team dedicated specifically to politics, which has doubled in size since 2012. The features it offers candidates include identifying potential voters or volunteers and tracking donations. The platform also enables a politician to host a Q&A, like Hillary Clinton recently did, which it can push to certain ZIP codes or email addresses. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4S0K0P00qD002LBW0YAu> . 

Tapping The App Supply 

Google debuted features and ad products for mobile apps on Wednesday, TechCrunch reports. Google will now allow search ads for apps within its Play Store (which means apps will be able to pay for real estate like brands do on ecommerce sites). For Android app developers, Google is piloting search app install ads across its platforms. The firm also surfaced a new metric, “first app opens,” which lets a developer know when a downloaded app is first opened. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/iLSW00BuPZL00A000Dq2A04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Just Not That Into It 

Upstart digital publishers are “just not that into ad tech,” writes the Journal’s Mike Shields. Vox, Mic.com and Refinery29 have been vocal about working with as few ad tech firms as possible. “We are not running any programmatic whatsoever,” said Mic.com CEO Chris Altchek, meaning that the publisher sells direct to advertisers. But in an interview with Capital New York <http://go.adexchanger.com/FuDBL00Pv0W0P2Mq000AA04> , Mike Hadgis, Vox’s VP of global revenue, sings a different tune. “DigitasLBI and Vox Media both embrace combining technology, data, and creative to help brands tell stories to the Vox Media audiences and beyond,” he said of the publisher’s recent agency partnership. Well, do they or don’t they? Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0uw0B4L0Q2AAP00q0DM00> . 

#Irrelevant 

Twitter’s got a big problem with its ads biz, eMarketer reports. According to a survey by financial services firm Cowen and Co, six in 10 Twitter users say the ads they see on the platform are irrelevant to their interests. A pitiful 3.1% of survey respondents said Twitter ads are insightful, while more than a quarter described the ads as “OK.” But the majority of respondents felt that Twitter ads were a poor fit. According to eMarketer, “The results suggests that advertisers need to step up targeting capabilities if they want to reach the right audience on Twitter.” TellApart to the rescue?

The Amazon Ecosystem 

Amazon has introduced Launchpad, a shopping and discovery platform that positions the firm against a host of startups in the shipping, payments and ecommerce space. Three partners that lend major cachet and capabilities to Amazon include Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator and Indiegogo. For startups in tech hardware or general goods, manufacturing is now the only major impediment. As Marc Andreessen points out in the release, this is another way Amazon is developing into “a real ecosystem.” Read on at TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000y2040qAuLPDBMS0WA0> . 

Welcome BI 

Business Insider is launching a standalone technology site named Tech Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000z2040qAuLPDBMT0WA0>  using a $25 million investment from German publisher Axel Springer. Tech Insider will have a staff of 40, though ad sales will continue to run through a central team. It’s a pivot into a crowded tech space. BI is also trying to decide whether diversifying into a portfolio is smarter than hosting diverse platforms under one banner (à la BuzzFeed).

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google Publishers Must Add Cookie Consent For EU Visitors 

To comply with EU data protection laws, Google is requiring publishers to add cookie consent for users coming in from EU countries. Google’s new user consent policy would affect publishers using AdSense, DoubleClick Ad Exchange and DoubleClick for Publishers. To comply, publishers have to implement code adding cookie consent on their desktop and mobile sites and apps. The requirement places an unwelcome burden on publishers and Google, which needs implicit consent  <http://go.adexchanger.com/o021000AF00uPW04DABAqL0> to target advertising to users. Read Google’s blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PBB00000AF4Dq02uW20> . 

Home Screen Conquest 

Mobile ad startup InMobi has teamed with Samsung and several other device makers in a play to extend its reach to more than 650 million smartphones. InMobi, which is backed by SoftBank, will embed its tech on Samsung phones in order to display ads on a device’s home or locked screen. But InMobi’s tech is more advanced than that. “If the sensors show you’re looking at your phone from a reclined angle, I know you are relaxing and I will show you an ad for some soothing music from a singer that I know you like,” explained InMobi Chief Financial Officer Manish Dugar. Bloomberg has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PCDFA40LuB003A> . 

Insta Tarot 

By 2017 Instagram’s global mobile ad revenue will hit $2.8 billion and account for more than 10% of Facebook’s global ad revenue. If true it would be more than quadruple the $594 million Facebook’s photo-sharing service is estimated to rake in this year. By the end of 2015, “Instagram will have a host of new ad products for advertisers large and small,” explained Debra Aho Williamson, an eMarketer principal analyst. “In particular, Instagram advertisers will be able to use a full slate of Facebook targeting tools, including the popular Custom Audiences feature.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P440F0DDAuq2> . 

The Hand That Feeds 

It’s been a tumultuous few days for the Google app store, with ad fraudsters  <http://go.adexchanger.com/yuFWDqP00A0LAB504E00020> taking advantage of malicious apps. Google has suspended some apps, but didn’t go so far as to specify what policy violations were being cited. Google also set new guidelines for app install ads, saying an interstitial format is prohibitively annoying to users. Whether it’s indexing in-app data for its own purposes or making decrees that bind advertising on external platforms like Yelp, whose CEO was furious about Google’s announcement <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00u06F0WFDP0L0A00> , the digital behemoth is gearing up for a showdown with the apps that live off it. 

Fretting About Podcasts 

The New York Times takes a deep dive into the world of podcast advertising, a medium less regulated by the FCC than commercial radio. But less regulation can lead to a blurring of lines between editorial and sponsored content, the story claims. “You won’t hear overt promotion, such as endorsements, testimonials, specific product prices or calls to purchase,” said NPR spokeswoman Isabel Lara of NPR podcasts. “But you may hear how you can engage the sponsor or its products or services a little more directly than what the FCC would allow.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00G07L0FW00AD2q0uA04> .


Mapping Search To Display 

Facebook’s Atlas and Guthy-Renker, a direct-response marketing firm, conducted a study on the tie between paid search and display ad spending. The research, which tracked 12,000 online buyers through a digital path to purchase, showed that one in six customers first saw a display ad before clicking on a search placement. It isn’t groundbreaking research, but another example of the importance of measuring campaigns across channels if you want an accurate view of a conversion funnel.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Content: Gateway To Revenue 

Snapchat added some new publishers to its Discover content hub, among them BuzzFeed and Vox. The additions come after a redesign that makes Discover more prominent in Snapchat’s navigation. Snapchat’s ad prices, initially sky-high, have since fallen. Re/code’s Kurt Wagner and Peter Kafka point out, “Publishers make more money if they bring in advertisers for their channel. In other words, it pays to spend time and effort on the content.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0u1A0000q0Dx20LAWA> . 

Protective Progressive 

Car makers have been vocal in recent months about not sharing driver data from in-car consoles. But for the tech giants who are hungry for it, there may be other routes to access that information. Take, for instance, car insurers, which pay willing policyholders to monitor their driving. Whaddya say, guys? Alas, “We do not have plans to sell driving data as an additional revenue stream,” Progressive spokesman Jeff Sibel tells Bloomberg. “We know customers place a lot of trust in us to protect their data.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/gy0D40L0q20uBA0AW0002AP> . 

Content Seizure 

San Francisco-based ad agency Mekanism grabbed Epic Signal in a bid to own more branded content. Epic Signal works with brands like Bud Light and NBC, creating video campaigns that run across YouTube, Snapchat, Vine, Periscope and Instagram. Mekanism CEO Jason Harris tells Adweek the acquisition cost “several million,” and said, “We could come up with the concept and produce the content, but we were missing the way to distribute it to make a hit." Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0P3BzD000qA2A04L0u> . 

TV’s Summer Funk 

The tectonic move from broadcast to streaming is playing out in painful ways for networks (and good ways for digital networks). Ad Age calls 2015 <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0u4A0000q0DA20LAWA>  “a season of plummeting viewership stats.” “True Detective” is the top-rated scripted series this summer, for instance, but isn’t supported by ads. Meanwhile, the WSJ reports, Comcast is considering investments in Business Insider, Vox Media, BuzzFeed and Vice. Twenty-five percent fewer 18-34-year-olds watch prime-time TV than viewers over the age of 55, so TV companies increasingly will look to digital. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0u0BWD0L4P50A2q0A0BA00> . 

Booming Data 

Palantir Technologies, a company that sells data mining software to clients on Wall Street and government agencies, announced a $450 million round of funding and a valuation of $20 billion. The company has raised about a billion to date, and is a key technology provider to the CIA and FBI. The market for human-tracking technology (whether consumers, citizens or suspects) appears to be thriving. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00AC0ALAWP6uB02q000> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Centro Buys Social 

Centro snapped up GraphScience for an undisclosed sum in a bid to extend its ad buying hooks to Facebook and other social platforms. Ten employees come with the bargain, and Centro says it will hire more to further build out GraphScience's social ad capabilities. Read the blog post. Centro says it will manage $400 million in advertiser spend this year. 

Amazon FTW 

Amazon turned in a boffo Q2, led by explosive growth in its Amazon Web Services cloud computing and data storage division. Amazon's "other" segment, which houses its ad biz along with credit card services, grew about 10% to $235 million – up from $213 million a year ago. All of that growth was in North America; in fact, international "other" revenues shrank slightly. Amazon's stock price spiked dramatically, giving Amazon a higher valuation than Walmart. Earnings release <http://go.adexchanger.com/uk0000DB4L0A0G02sPqWAu0> . 

Publicis Rough Patch 

In its own Q2 report, French agency group Publicis said revenue grew 39% to $2.7 billion, but the vast majority of growth came from SapientNitro and other acquisitions. Organic growth was a meager 1%. Chief Executive Maurice Lévy said, “Publicis had a patchy year. … And I’m putting this in charitable terms.” Managerial teams at Publicis have reduced in size since the fall of 2013, he explained, creating a scarcity of talent. On the upside, “Digital activities accounted for over half our revenue in this first half-year, as did our operations in America.” Read the release (PDF) <http://go.adexchanger.com/GuB0As20DH4lW0AL0000P0q> . 

FT Gets A New Owner 

Japanese publisher Nikkei will acquire the Financial Times from UK publishing group Pearson for $1.3 billion. The Financial Times reports that Nikkei submitted an 11th-hour offer, outbidding rival bidder Axel Springer of Germany. “We’ve reached an inflection point in media, driven by the explosive growth of mobile and social,” said FT Chief Executive John Fallon. “In this new environment, the best way to ensure the FT’s journalistic and commercial success is for it to be part of a global, digital news company.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0uI0B4L0m2AAP00q0Ds00> . 

Booking It 

Move fast, scale quickly and drive better UX – those are TripAdvisor’s top three near-term goals, said CEO Steve Kaufer, speaking on the travel site’s Q2 2015 earnings call. TripAdvisor’s Instant Booking product – which allows visitors to book hotels without leaving TRIP’s O&O – will be a big part of the engine behind that hoped-for growth. Marriott, Hyatt and several other large hotel chains are signed on to enable Instant Booking. Click-based revenue was responsible for 66% of revenue, down from 73% in Q2 2014, a decrease blamed on foreign exchange rates. Display-based revenue increased 8% to $40 million. Total revenue grew 25% for the quarter to $405 million.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic Vs. Viewability? 

A study by ad verifier Meetrics suggests that programmatic buying is exacerbating the viewability problem. The research found Germany and France have higher viewability rates than the UK or US, where programmatic has been adopted more rapidly. In the UK, 45% of ads were purchased programmatically last year, but only 49% were viewable by 2015’s second quarter. In Germany and France, viewability levels hit 64% and 62% in Q2, respectively. “The benefit of programmatic is better targeting – which should make it more cost effective, and is why it continues to grow," said Anant Joshi, Meetrics’ director of international business. "But there are serious viewability issues." Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0uAAm0D7l00> . 

Buy Now 

Over the past few months, all the major social media platforms have made strides in developing direct-to-user ecommerce solutions (generally in the form of a buy button). While analysts say this is a natural step, don’t expect Facebook or Pinterest to be the next Amazon. One observer compares social media commerce to affiliate links: more a result of user migration than a reflection of changing shopping habits. Time will tell if the rise of messenger apps brings the same progression. Read more at The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00D8A02000BWl0q4unLP0A> . 

Millennial Adds Formats 

Millennial Media launched a handful of products for mobile video and native ads. The new ads include features that let advertisers add events or notices directly to a user’s calendar, as well as a new ad unit, “Lightbox,” that incorporates swipe, touch and sound into interactive video elements. Millennial Platform President Matt Gillis called the release “our most comprehensive offering to date.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00l90ALAWPouB02q000> . 

Podcast Advertising Acquisition 

Scripps snapped up podcast ad network Midroll Media on Wednesday for an undisclosed sum. Midroll connects more than 240 advertisers to 200-plus independent and large podcasts, among them “WTF with Marc Maron,” “StartUp” and “Nerdist.” According to Scripps Chief Digital Officer Adam Symson, “We're witnessing another significant shift in how audiences and advertisers interact with digital media. Smartphones are everywhere, over-the-top audio streaming is at an all-time high and consumers are connecting through their cars in record numbers, especially young people.” Podcast’s moment continues. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/GuB0Al20Dp4aW0AL0000P0q> . 

Consultants Keep Chasing Marketing 

Management consulting firm Accenture has acquired Chaotic Moon, a “creative technology studio,” for an undisclosed sum. Austin, Texas-based Chaotic Moon has worked on digital content for brands like Disney and Marvel and invented a “smart cart” for Whole Foods that follows shoppers around stores. Chaotic Moon will be rolled into Accenture Interactive, the consulting firm’s digital arm, and will work closely with Accenture’s design and innovation unit, Fjord. Earlier this month, Accenture snapped up PacificLink Group, an independent digital agency. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0buA00qlD0AP00040> . Consultants are hungry.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Antitrust Allegations 

Google’s headaches abroad just intensified. Several rivals of the tech giant, including OpenX and AppNexus, have asked regulators in Brussels to investigate Google’s dominance of the ad tech market. The Financial Times reports that representatives from Google’s competitors have visited the European Commission in recent months to plead their antitrust case, though no formal complaint has been filed. But experts on European competition law say that bringing a case against Google related to the ad tech market would be challenging, “as there is a dearth of data about the size and shape of the market and the extent of Google’s dominance.” Read on. 

Ad Tech Takes Flack 

Writing for The Guardian, Felix Salmon takes a whack at ad tech, which is apparently responsible for all deficiencies in mobile and desktop web browsing. “Ads’ thirst for bandwidth seems destined to increase relentlessly, whether or not bandwidth itself increases quickly enough to meet that need.” Read it. Publisher culpability? Nowhere in sight. Meanwhile, The Verge’s Nilay Patel pens a similar but more nuanced post, pointing to Facebook’s Instant Articles and Apple News as pushback against slow load times and bad user experiences. 

Ready For Takeoff 

Much-hyped ecommerce heavyweight Jet.com officially launched on Tuesday with plans to spend over $100 million on marketing over the next 12 months. Jet is a members-only online retailer that charges $49.99 per year in exchange for discounts on specific products and expanded rewards programs (similar to Costco, Jet’s profits will come from membership dues and not product margins). When you consider that Jet’s only chance for profit is a massive pool of annual subscribers, it’s no wonder marketing represents such a huge expenditure out of the gates. Read on at Ad Age. And, read AdExchanger’s earlier look at Jet.com. 

Investing In Turkey 

Performance marketing firm Adphorus closed a $1 million seed round of funding on Tuesday as it eyes expansion in Western Europe and emerging markets. A group of European angel investors and 500 Startups, an early-stage accelerator program, led the round. Adphorus, a Facebook Marketing Partner, is based in Istanbul. Read the release. 

Adopting A New Banner Ad 

Condé Nast has run its first campaign using the native, in-house unit (dubbed 23 Stories) that it launched earlier this year. The goal of 23 Stories is to give advertisers a more direct, functional relationship with the editorial team and “work across the entire asset stack.” In this case, that means eschewing digital in favor of print, as a Samsung-branded fridge is Bon Appétit’s first-ever sponsored cover. (Condé Nast’s Teen Vogue featured a sponsored cover in April.) Read more at Adweek.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

WPP Scouts Social Data 

In a holding companywide deal, WPP’s GroupM synched up with Networked Insights, a Chicago-based social listening firm that mines more than 560 million social media posts per day. The goal is to tap into data about what consumers share on social platforms, in order to serve more targeted ads. “We can ID prospective target audiences and ID characteristics of people who are coming in or out of the customer base so we can develop strategies and tactics to influence them,” GroupM Chairman Irwin Gotlieb told The Wall Street Journal. Network Insights has raised $47 million in funding and works with roughly 65 advertisers. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PnB00000Aa4Dq02uWj0> . 

Visible World Gets A COO 

Comcast has named former Cablevision ad sales chief David Kline president and COO of its Visible World division, a TV ad tech firm the broadcaster acquired in June. “We see a very big future in programmatic, and we are really going to ramp up our efforts,” Kline said in an interview with Variety. According to Kline, Comcast’s reach extends to about 75 million households, and the cable giant wants to use that reach to sell advertisers audiences, not spots. “If [advertisers] want men who make over $100,000 and own their own homes and have two kids, we will sell them those.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/GuB0Aa20Do4kW0AL0000P0q> . 

The Strong Get Stronger 

Business Insider takes a look at 4-year-old Walmart Labs, a collection of 2,200 “technologists” in Silicon Valley that attack ecommerce and data issues for the retail giant. The technology nerve center has “no direct place in the brick-and-mortar operation,” but the company is finding that more and more of the decisions made by its data scientists are driving real-time, in-store results. The retailer's’ decision last year to build its own ad platform, “Walmart Exchange,” has also helped it surf the wave of emerging tech. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tp0Wa0P0u000DBl20L4qAA0> . 

Slinging Ads 

The latest streaming TV offering from EchoStar-owned Sling Media will expand its use of advertising, Jeff Baumgartner reports for Multichannel News. The new ad experiences will run on Sling's standalone apps geared to PC and mobile viewers, and will offset revenue the company expects to lose when it stops charging for those apps. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00aA0L0Dm00uB2qW0AqP04>  Meanwhile Sling has dropped a new ad campaign, where "old TV" companies are portrayed as schoolyard bullies. Tagline: “It’s time to say goodbye to the way TV used to be." More at AgencySpy <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqrB0u2LW004D0P0AAn0a00> . 

Football Fallout 

TV advertising spend in the US dipped 5% in 2015’s second quarter, according to data from Standard Media Index (SMI). Bear in mind that the men’s FIFA World Cup soccer tournament generated more than $500 million in TV ad spend in 2014’s second quarter and outpaced ad spend surrounding the women’s competition this year. “However, there are some underlying factors that are contributing to a deeper malaise,” said SMI CFO James Fennessy. “Soft ratings and ongoing measurement issues continue to impact television’s results and we also saw a slight slowdown in the explosive growth from digital, which points to marketers focusing more closely on return on investment." Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0u0oWD0L4Ps0A2q0a0BA00> . 

Paying For Less 

Google is making a run at Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime with a new ad-free subscription TV service, and betting on its YouTube stars to help win the fight. “The company has advised partners like top draw PewDiePie that their clips won't be allowed to remain on the public, ad-supported YouTube if they don't also sign up for the commercial-free subscription version.” It remains to be seen whether a combination of those stars, other online series and music videos will be enough to sustain a subscription service in an already competitive space.

Floating The FT 

Bloomberg reports the Financial Times is exploring a potential sale following a buyout offer. The London-based newspaper, owned by Pearson, is being considered at a valuation around $1.6 billion (roughly six times what Jeff Bezos paid for The Washington Post two years ago). The suitors haven’t been named, but German publisher Axel Springer is mentioned as a possible contender. On the other hand, one analyst cited called the FT a “trophy asset,” adding that, “If Pearson can get 1 billion pounds for the FT I will eat my hat.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/laBqu000LuDP0A2A4000q0W> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

First-Party Data On Instagram

In an interview with eMarketer, Instagram exec Jim Squires talks up the opportunity around Facebook’s targeting data. Today advertisers on Instagram can only access gender, age and location data. Squires said Instagram “will be introducing new targeting functionality that will mirror what’s also available on the Facebook side. One of the products is Custom Audiences, where the advertiser is bringing their own information to the table and might commingle it with information from the Facebook and Instagram platforms.” Read the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0uAAj0Dj600> . 

Facebook Caves On Viewability 

Until now, Facebook has bucked the viewability trend, charging an advertiser when any portion of an ad passes within the “viewport” (i.e., in-screen portion of a user’s news feed). No longer. The WSJ reports that in the coming weeks Facebook will allow advertisers to start paying only when an ad is 100% in-view. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PkB00000A64Dq02uWk0>  Notably there’s nothing here about time exposure. The industry’s two dueling standards, from the IAB/MRC and GroupM, require exposures of one and two seconds, respectively. 

Hulu Plus Plus 

Hulu will try out an ad-free service this fall, reports Ad Age. Subscriptions will run viewers between $12 or $14 per month, according to reports. Hulu’s first experiment with a paid tier was Hulu Plus, which gave viewers access to more content, though they still experienced ads – if fewer. The firm ditched the name of its paid tier, supposedly to pave the way for its new subscription model. Hulu’s subscriber base was recently reported somewhere north of 9 million. Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0l60Lu0DB0l0W0q4P20A0A> . 

App-Web Wars 

Digital giants with reach across the web and the app world (Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft) have been pushing for new protocols regarding how mobile app developers index their content and make data available. Google and Microsoft’s Bing, for instance, want to be able to index results from apps and sites, and then build a set of connections deep-linking the two spheres. Mobile app makers, who essentially have mini walled gardens, are (like the big walled gardens they’re working with) reluctant to give up their internal data. Read on at Bloomberg <http://go.adexchanger.com/GuB0A620Dm4mW0AL0000P0q> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

AOL On Parade 

AOL Platforms CTO Seth Demsey opens up to Business Insider on the Verizon-AOL merger, and claims the value’s in registered and verified data. “We are an ads company, we already have some of that,” he said. “You can imagine what that looks like when put together.” That said, Demsey called the addition of Verizon’s user data incremental, not game-changing. “Not to say that scaled data isn’t exciting – it is … but there’s a lot on the table.” Added to the pile is Microsoft’s display ads business, which AOL is in the process of absorbing in a single gulp.

Microsoft Still Kicking? 

Speaking of Microsoft, the company’s chief envisioning officer, Dave Coplin, strikes down assumptions that the company is pivoting away from the advertising and marketing tech. “We are very firmly in both of those worlds,” Coplin told The Drum at the Jellyfish Digital Journey’s event in Brighton, England. “Whether you are in marketing or advertising or health; it doesn’t matter,” he added. “If you can use our technology to get a better result then we’ve done our job.” But after offloading its advertising business to AOL, it’s unclear what Microsoft’s reimagined advertising strategy will look like.

Agencies Doldrums, Cont. 

Stocks from Publicis, Omnicom, Interpublic and WPP are all down in the second quarter, and Interpublic in particular has taken a blow, tumbling more than 10%, The Wall Street Journal observes. But! While the agency-client discourse has been dominated by the interconnected issues of rebates and widespread agency reviews, it’s important to bear in mind that all four market leaders are expected to post modest organic revenue gains this quarter. All will become clear once the tens of billions up for grabs in the current pitchapalooza involving 20-plus global advertisers find a home. The WSJ has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWM400G0ABD0000uL02P0Aq> . 

Fraud In The USA 

According to native ad firm MGID, the US is the global leader in fraudulent traffic. MGID compiled data based on analysis of more than 30 million invalid clicks worldwide and found that the US accounted for 26% of fraudulent traffic running through MGID’s ad network (the UK accounted for 19%). “The US market is the most lucrative one due to higher CPMs and online advertising spendings which leads to the development of the most sophisticated robotic traffic pretending to be human,” explained MGID CEO Sergey Denisenko.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

GroupM’s Clark On Reviews And Rebates 

Speaking to The Drum, GroupM North America chief Kelly Clark shares his two cents on the watershed number of media accounts in review. “A lot of the reviews that are taking place are agency/client relationships that have existed for five or ten years and in some cases even longer,” Clark explained. It could just be that emerging tech necessitates re-evaluation. As for the rebates discussion: “It's human nature and it's good business practice to ask those questions when allegations like that are made,” he said. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0W0P4qA02000WLS0H0AtDB> . 

Dynamic TV Delays 

Networks have been beating the drum around “dynamic ad insertion” for TV for at least two years now, but it’s slow going. Nick Troiano, CEO of TV ad tech company Black Arrow, told attendees at a Bernstein Research conference that demand for the tech was nil until TV ratings began to dip last year. And legacy carriage deals between channels and pay TV distributors are blocking the adoption of new technology, as they tend to last a long time. But Troiano claims that bringing dynamically inserted ads to TV will increase efficiency and boost revenue in the long term. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWT400I0ABD00W0tL02P0Aq> . 

News You Can Use 

Publishers participating in Facebook’s Instant Articles rollout appear happy with the program, despite results being almost nonexistent (the test audience represents only 5% of mobile iOS users in the US who have downloaded the app). The NYT is aiming for 30 articles a day, while The Atlantic said it would prefer to post almost all its content directly to Facebook. BuzzFeed plans to use Instant Articles as much as it can. Why the instant adoption despite earlier publisher unease <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqJP04A0LB0WAW02t0000UD> ? Because social media platforms are gaining massive market share as news sources, according to new data from Pew <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0WA0DB0WV2Lq00tA00K4P0> . 

Monkeying Around 

Indian mobile ad platform InMobi, the largest mobile network outside of Facebook and Google, launched a “discovery” service for mobile content with a more user-centric ad experience. The service is driven by a monkey named Miip who will guide users based on ongoing searches. Don’t be fooled by the resemblance to Clippy <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0tLA0q0W0BAL0PDW2> . VentureBeat says Miip represents a big step in how developers and marketers are deep-linking in apps to drive commerce. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0XWtWPM0A00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Vice Is A Virtue 

At least it is for Verizon, which will license content from the media company for its upcoming mobile video service. Vice will channel new and existing content from its digital channels to Verizon’s service, which is expected to launch this year and will be geared to a teen demographic. The hidden story here could involve Vice’s digital strategy. The publisher has been striking deals left and right, including recent partnerships with HBO, Spotify and Snapchat. Read on via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00A0PL0SW00AD2q0tA04> . 

Marketing Pangaea 

Nielsen is extending its digital ad measurement to new markets in Asia and Latin America. The move will give Nielsen’s ratings coverage across 95% of global ad spending. The focus is on enabling measurement for giant global advertisers, but publishers hope more precise ratings will lift prices and budgets. The race is (still) on between Nielsen and comScore to become the industry standard as marketers push for holistic measurement. The Financial Times has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0QtA00BSD0AP00040> . 

Agencies: Buckle Up 

It’s a turbulent time for agencies. Adweek reports that American Airlines in the next player to put its media agency up for review. The airline carrier has been with McCann Erickson and agency TM in New York and Dallas for two decades. However, “The competitive landscape of our industry and the advertising industry has changed since the last time we put our business out for bid,” American Airlines said in a statement. “We want to ensure we align ourselves with the right agency who understands our goals.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqCP04A0LB0WAS02t0000RD> . 

Not In View: Mobile 

The MRC says mobile is making viewability measurement murkier. In its latest round of reconciliation testing, the MRC looked at viewable impressions for campaigns in the US across data sets from publishers, advertisers and agencies. Where discrepancies in vendor results were found, the MRC attributed 54% of inconsistencies to the different ways vendors count viewable impressions on mobile. As per the data, nothing else came close to causing as many discrepancies. eMarketer has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00SS0ALAWPDtB02q000> . 

Outside The Box 

The future of search isn’t search at all (or at least not putting queries in a box), it’s anticipating needs. At least that’s the bet being made by companies like Yahoo and Google (throw in Apple as well), who are turning their attention to personal assistant apps that can predict a user’s requirements. Products like Siri, Google Now and Yahoo’s Smart Stream lack brand integrations today, but adding them could be lucrative for companies that can weather the controversy.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

The Slipping Screen 

Is upfront ad selling on the way out? Hard to say, but it’s not as lucrative as it used to be, and there is a general sense of doom and gloom among TV broadcasters as ratings decline and audiences find other channels to get their viewing on. But it’s hard to pinpoint just how bad it is, The Wall Street Journal points out, because there’s not a lot of transparency in the process. Still, big brands like McDonald’s, Verizon Wireless (supposedly reducing its budget by double digits) and State Farm are cutting back in a major way. Analysts seem to be circling around a 5-10% drop-off in TV advertising this year, to the benefit of online video and other digital channels. Additionally, advertisers are holding their wallets closed in order to have more TV buying flexibility as program air dates loom. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00t0UM0WzDP0L0A00> . 

Netflix’s Road Map 

Speaking at MediaPost’s OMMA Programmatic Display conference, Netflix’s global director of programmatic marketplace and channel development, Kathy O’Dowd, says the platform sees the potential in programmatic to target viewers at scale. “We are moving to programmatic, in part, because it is so efficient,” she said. “We can be more individualised in the kind of marketing that we're doing, and that's ultimately … every advertiser's dream.” Online video viewing habits can betray a lot of insight into a user’s interests, and Netflix hopes to tap into its trove of user data to inform its push into programmatic. But in the short term, Netflix’s main goal is to expand its user base, O’Dowd said. Warc has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0t00MqAV> . 

Face The Facts 

Marketers, including some from industry leaders like M&C Saatchi and Ogilvy, are developing tools that read and code facial gestures as a way to gauge users’ reactions to marketing content. For now, the technology is being used primarily in the creative-testing process and is thought to be more reliable than traditional focus groups. However, some retailers have begun deploying cameras in stores that have similar capabilities, and if phones someday onboarded the tech, it could lead to a whole new realm of marketing data and opportunity. Or, at worst, a chance to really freak out consumers. More via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0tBA0000q0DW20LAWM> . 

Nordic Programmatic 

Programmatic advertising is picking up in Norway, eMarketer reports. According to June research from Nordic RTB buyer Delta Projects, programmatic ad spend has increased 212% in the country in the past year and accounted for 12% of total digital display spend last year. And according to Peter Karlsson, the country manager of Delta Projects Norway, “In 2015, non-RTB programmatic trading will be the main factor driving continued growth in the market.” eMarketer projects that digital display ad spend in Norway will grow 10.3% in 2015 to reach $401.7 million.

Driving Sales 

Automotive lead-generation company TrueCar and AutoNation, the country’s largest new-car retailer, parted ways over a dispute regarding data rights. Simply put: TrueCar wants more data from AutoNation about transactions. AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson: “Over my dead body.” But this disagreement is not about customer privacy concerns as much as it is about attribution. AutoNation said TrueCar was responsible for 3% of its sales. TrueCar begs to differ with that tally, claiming 7%. It simply wants the data to perform an accurate audit! But there’s another issue at play, according to AutoNation: TrueCar is emerging as a competitor. "[TrueCar is] going to inject themselves into the arrangement of financing, they're going to have a service product, they're going to have a trade-in product,” said Jackson. “So they're going for the entire spectrum of the auto retail business."

Getting The Algorithms We Deserve 

Researchers from the Wharton School have released a report titled “Overcoming Algorithm Aversion: People Will Use Algorithms If They Can (Even Slightly) Modify Them.” The paper gets into a cruel irony that plagues many on the marketing and tech side: why evidence-based algorithms that “consistently outperform human forecasters” are just as consistently abandoned by users. The research finds that giving users even a small degree of control over the algorithm results in higher satisfaction and toleration of errors.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

The Driver’s Seat 

Carmakers are firmly behind the wheel when it comes to controlling driver data, Reuters reports. The systems that link smartphones to “infotainment” systems in vehicles will pool user data, but Apple and Google could be boxed out. "We need to control access to that data," said Don Butler, Ford Motor’s executive director of connected vehicles. "We need to protect our ability to create value.” And one VW spokesperson claims that Apple and Google “asked for more data than we are willing to share.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02a000JG00tPW04DABAqL0> . 

Once Bitten 

Facebook’s move last week to give users more control over what/who populates news feeds has created a stretch of prime real estate that brands are hoping to fill. Users can select from the brands that they’ve “liked” in the past to take the top spots on the feed. It’s a titillating opportunity for marketers, but analysts caution that Facebook has created similar openings before, only to slam the door shut. It used to be that an ad buy guaranteed “likes” and organic reach for miles, but Facebook has whittled away value. Read more via Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000K2040qAtLPDBGb0WA0> . 

Attention! 

Despite a push from premium publishers like The Financial Times and The Economist Group for attention-based metrics, not all advertisers are sold on the idea. “We’re not buying that way,” Media Kitchen president Barry Lowenthal told Digiday. “We’re buying clicks, impressions [and] audience. That’s the criteria we’re looking at when we’re evaluating performance.” But while attention metrics may have their limitations, advertisers could be less hesitant to adopt them when it comes to video advertising, where completion rates are key.

When The 800-Pound Gorilla Isn’t Strong Enough 

Despite its utter dominance in cable TV –“trouncing” other channels, according to The WSJ – ESPN is tightening its belt as more users cut cords. Nielsen data shows that ESPN, which again is outcompeting its cable rivals, has lost over 3 million subscribers in the past year alone. ESPN would have to charge over $30 per month for OTT packages in order to earn what it does today. Many are looking to ESPN as an industry bellwether – or canary in the coal mine – as sports has been considered the great bulwark against the move to digital programming.

Digital Advertising 2020 

Mobile is the fastest-growing ad channel, according to a report from BI Intelligence that predicts US mobile ad revenue will rise 26.5% by 2020. Digital video spend is also outpacing search and display, and it’s projected to rise at a compounded annual growth rate of 21.9% by 2020. “The rapid embrace of programmatic ad-buying tools is fueling a dramatic uptick in the share of digital ad spending coming through programmatic channels,” reports Business Insider in a summary of the findings. “Programmatic transactions will be a majority of total US digital ad spend this year.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0t0eWD0L4PN0A2q0G0BA00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook’s ‘Finders Keepers’

Facebook has been skating on thin ice with publishers, as products like Instant Articles provide new revenue streams for content producers but put the social media in charge. Now, anonymous publishers are claiming that Facebook plans to institute a new policy in November that will force pubs from Facebook mobile ads if they don’t agree to divulge “device-level attribution data” about customers downloading apps. The unnamed publishing execs believe Facebook will use the information to retarget on behalf of competitive apps. The policy could also cause friction with Apple, notoriously sensitive about sharing user data. More at VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00N0kL0AW00AD2q0tA04> .

Apple News Looms

Fast Company’s Joel Johnson takes a look at Apple’s publishing product, Apple News, which will be baked into iOS 9. Though ads were not displayed in the app’s demo, Johnson says they will be an integral part of Apple News. But bigger questions loom about the changing nature of publisher relationships with Apple and Facebook. “Let's not mistake the upside for Apple: it can appeal to user experience and privacy and be a force for good, while simultaneously creating an environment where it not only controls the publishing channel through its app, but also scrapes a percentage of the advertising for its effort,” writes Johnson. “This has immediate consequences for independent media at the operational level.” Power to the platform. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bt00OW2A000040AB0DlLPqA> .

Playing Along

eMarketer estimates that more than half of the US population will be mobile phone gamers this year. Though ad spend isn’t following the trend quite yet, that could change once marketers realize game developers’ reach. “I can leverage a program for Coca-Cola today that reaches 28 million unique users in the US through one title,” said Julie Shumaker, VP of ad sales at game publisher Zynga. “In console, one publisher couldn’t reach 28 million users in a day, let alone a month.” And another trend that might sway advertisers on mobile games is the opportunity for brand integration, something Zynga and CrowdStar are already tinkering with.

Mobile Client Conquest

Mobile engagement platform SITO Mobile snapped up Hipcricket’s movie advertising business, in a takeover that extends SITO’s access to Hipcricket’s existing advertiser and brand clients. Hipcricket’s adServe platform helped it earn nearly $30 million in the last 30 months. “This transaction marks the successful culmination of a process we began over a year ago," said SITO Mobile CEO Jerry Hug. The cash and stock deal is worth $3.7 million. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0nQ02q0L0AB0Dt00AA4> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google’s Dog Food

In a new post on its Think With Google site, Google describes its adoption of programmatic for its own marketing efforts. According to digital media manager Brendan Starr, “Our goal for 2014 was to buy 60% of our worldwide brand display marketing programmatically across all channels. We surpassed that goal, with programmatic accounting for 73% of our spend.” An ongoing campaign for the Google Search App reached 30% more people three times more frequently with a 30% lower eCPM compared to 2013. Read on. <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00sA0L0Dp00tB2qW0AKP04> 

Facebook’s CPC Switch-Up

Facebook is adopting a new method for measuring clicks as part of its latest API release. Previously, Facebook measured likes, comments and shares to determine CPC, but as of Wednesday, only clicks on websites and apps count. In a blog post, Facebook says the update is designed to “provide measurement that’s more closely aligned with how advertisers are bidding.” And, once adopted, “Advertisers who care about link clicks are likely to see better return on advertising spend, since they’ll be paying for only the most valuable outcome.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40q0A2s0BLLD0WtP00q0A0> .

Sony Plugs Into Latin America

Sony Pictures Television will acquire a majority stake in IMS Internet Media Services, a Latin American digital ad sales and buying firm. Headquartered in Miami, IMS has struck commercial partnerships with firms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Spotify, iAds and Foursquare. Andy Kaplan, president of worldwide networks for Sony Pictures Television, said the company “will integrate practices and intelligence with our networks and ad sales teams in the region and globally, making this an excellent extension of our current business." Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PtM00q2r0s> .

Times Doubles Down On Content Studio

The New York Times is extending its T Brand Studio content marketing division overseas. A team of four in London will pioneer the unit, focusing on video. “We would love to have a nine-figure content marketing business and international will play a key role in that,” said Sebastian Tomich, SVP of advertising innovations for the NYT. To date, the 37-strong US T Brand Studio team has created 70 campaigns for 60 clients. The Guardian has more. <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DtBqA0020P0WsAsN00>  

Breaking Into TV

While digital publishers and ad firms have long fought for TV budgets, broadcasters may soon be courting the tech world. Though game makers like Machine Zone, Supercell and King have largely relied on digital advertising, Machine Zone saw profitable ROI from its Super Bowl ad featuring Kate Upton in Game of War: Fire Age. Simulmedia’s founder, Dave Morgan, sees this trend piggybacking on the increased ability to target and sharpen TV buys like brands do in digital, as well as a saturation of the inventory apps have mostly limited themselves to (aka Mobile Facebook placements). A new Simulmedia offering called SimulX aims to seize this opportunity. Read on at Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0tOA0q0t0BAL0PDs2> .

#HBD #2

One day after launching what TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine called a blatant grab for users’ DOB data <http://go.adexchanger.com/iQsW00BtPvL00A000Dq2A04> , Twitter celebrated a milestone of its own. Wednesday marked one year since the launch of its mobile app promotion offering. To mark the occasion, Twitter began the rollout of three beta products for global advertisers that will be available in the coming months: video app cards, cost-per-install bidding and so-called “optimized bidding,” which “allows app install advertisers to optimize their bids according to install, while still paying by app click,” according to Twitter product marketing manager Sherene Arjani. More via Twitter’s ad blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBR000Ast0A200WL4qPw00> . Twitter is finding DM religion.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Measure Better

Marketers are willing to spend more on digital ads, the WSJ reports, but they want better metrics. WPP agency Millward Brown Digital polled nearly 400 senior marketing execs from agencies, media firms and brands, and more than 70% said they’d increase their mobile, digital and social spend if ROI measurement improved. The demand for social metrics is particularly high, according to the data. When Millward Brown polled execs last year, 50% said they’d increase their social spend if offered better metrics, and that percentage grew to 74% this year. Considering Magna Global says digital ad spend will jump 16% to $149 billion this year, the stakes are high. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DtBqA0020P0WkAmz00> .

Gentlemen Prefer In-View

In the fall, GQ.com will roll out a digital redesign, and the publisher is making some adjustments in the interim intended to boost ad viewability. The slideshow format, as it’s being called, embeds display ads in a carousel-type collage alongside featured content. When a user browses the site on desktop, banner ads will also appear below and beside the slideshow. The magazine’s publisher, Howard Mittman, called the offering “about as close as you can get to 100% viewability.” Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqAB0t2LW004D0P0AAl0m00> .

Machine Learning Is Learning

Tech platforms are getting better at anticipating user requests (such as weather notices, sport scores and appointments) and that should make traditional search firms nervous. At least, that seems to be the case at Google, where Google Now, its AI assistant product meant to anticipate needs, is starting to take off. Apple, whose AI assistant is linked to Bing search results, is pursuing similar goals, but wants to undercut Google’s dominance in search. With Google pulling $5.6 billion in search traffic from Safari iOS alone (and that deal expiring this year), predictive AI is a sci-fi story with real-world consequences. Read on at Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0tBA0q0m0BAL0PDm2> .

Apsalar’s Facebook Hookup

Mobile attribution firm Apsalar is beefing up its mobile DMP with a feature that allows marketers to put app user segments to work. Announced Tuesday, Apsalar Audiences for Facebook is a step toward making its mDMP stickier with brands, which “can tailor their messages based on actual in-app customer behavior,” Apsalar CEO Michael Oiknine told AdExchanger. Do brands need an mDMP? <http://go.adexchanger.com/iCmW00BtPnL00A000Dq2A04>  The jury’s still out on that one, but Apsalar made a bet with the launch of its own mobile DMP in June. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000m2ot0L0B0DA4PDAq> .

#HBD

Twitter’s streamlined signup process is coming back to haunt it. The platform that prides itself on minimalism is offering a birthday balloon home page decal to any user willing to share his or her birth date. The blatant data grab is a clear indication that advertisers on the platform would benefit from better targeting, according to TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine, who argues that age range is a big omission.

The Music Of Ads

Saavn, India’s most popular music streaming service, may be less popular than platforms like Spotify and Pandora in the US. But with 14 million users it is gaining speed, thanks in part to an ad-supported model. On Tuesday it unveiled a $100 million round led by Tiger Global Management. “Music streaming is at the center of the music industry, and India is one of the most important music economies in the world,” said Saavn CEO Rishi Malhotra. “With 2 million Androids shipping each week, music is driving data consumption and redefining mobile advertising.” VentureBeat has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DtBqA0020P0WrAmG00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Ad Tech Foundations

In a think piece for the WSJ, Christopher Mims notes that many key figures in Internet technology innovation cut their teeth in digital advertising. “Since the debut of the Web banner ad in 1994, ad tech has been a finishing school for some of the greatest minds in tech history,” Mims writes, citing people like Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Square’s Gokul Rajaram. Why? Rajaram says it’s the data. “Advertising was the first commercial domain to which machine learning was used at scale,” he told Mims. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0otA00udD0AP00040> .

Believing In Buy Buttons

The NYT takes a deep dive into the rise of buy buttons, which are becoming increasingly important considering advertisers in the US are expected to spend more on mobile search ads this year than on desktop ($12.85 billion compared to $12.82 billion, according to eMarketer). But even as advertisers flock to mobile devices, where firms hope a single-touch interface will ease checkout processes, consumers are still inclined to use desktops to buy. AdMarketplace claims users convert 84% less by clicking on a mobile ad than by clicking through desktop search ads. Can buy buttons turn the tide? Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0pdtWPv0A00> .

Always Atwitter

Twitter revealed a mobile interface on Monday that lets advertisers manage campaigns on the go. The Twitter Ads companion, a suite of tools for iOS and Android devices, lets marketers check campaign performance, optimize budgets, tweak scheduling and reply to notifications. The app also lets marketers pause or resume campaigns, and signals alerts when total ad budgets near completion. The tools cater to an always-on marketer, according to a Twitter blog post, “since campaigns don’t stop running when the office closes.” Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/FtDBL00qw0W0P2dq000AA04> .

Marketing In Martian

Two pieces via Ad Age on Monday encapsulate some upcoming evolutions marketers will have to adjust to. One is a big pivot among children away from TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0rtA00xdD0AP00040> , which is now seen as “punishment” when kids lose their favorite screens: phones and tablets. Nickelodeon’s Nielsen ratings have tumbled more than 30% among 2- to 11-year-olds. Another article chronicles the rise of emojis and graphics <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0dWD0Ly000B4000ts>  in digital language, whether it’s on Instagram, messaging services or phone keyboards. Marketers, who can’t afford to tell all these kids to get off their lawn, are going to have to learn the lingo. The times, they are a-changing.

The Sleeping Giant Of Ride-Hailing

On Monday, Google launched a beta version of RideWith, a potential Uber competitor that deals specifically with ride-sharing. According to The Verge, “RideWith calculates a cost based on the anticipated fuel consumption and ‘depreciation’ based on mileage, and the driver is free to accept or decline the ride.” The beta is launching in Tel Aviv only, but if other ride-hailing apps aren’t worried already, news also broke last Friday <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0zL0000dP02BAqDt0t40A>  that Chrome for Android became Google’s 12th app to hit a billion downloads. Google’s looking to expand on the ad empire it has built by veering into a potentially lucrative niche. Read on at VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/ytdWDqP00A0LABu04A00020> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Suggesting Videos 

Facebook is testing a way for video content creators to leverage its platform (à la YouTube). The idea is to have “suggested” videos – including ads – pop up when a user watches an in-feed video. Facebook and the creators will split the revenue generated from all suggested ads a user clicks. TBD if this method proves more effective than YouTube pre-roll.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DwA02000BW80q4txLP0A> Ad Age has more.

Automation Across The Americas 

Speaking to eMarketer, Internet Media Services CMO Maren Lau said Brazil is leading the programmatic charge in Latin America. But “there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done,” she said. “One of the challenges to programmatic in the region is that there isn’t a lot of digital inventory available, and what is available is not yet piped into major programmatic platforms.” Geolocation targeting is also on the rise in Latin America, driven primarily by marketing efforts in Mexico. Read the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DW84tA00yL0PB0x2> . 

Bio-Segments 

The Drum reports on a startup called BlisMedia, whose technology pools data from barometric sensors in smartphones. “In New York or Singapore, for instance, advertisers will be able to send different messages to people on the ground floor, likely to be in the shopping mall, [and] to office workers on upper floors,” explained BlisMedia CEO Greg Isbister. If successfully developed, the sensors could also measure heart rate and blood pressure. But from a consumer standpoint, the creep factor for biometric data could be sky-high. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Ptz00q2y08> .

Ad Tech Cynic 

Writing for LinkedIn, Michael Wolff lambasts ad agencies that have gotten hung up on trading audiences rather than creating “grand illusions” – i.e., storytelling. “Advertising agencies have de-emphasized, even hollowed out, what had been their core talent and purpose – crafting vivid and theatrical consumer fantasies – in favor of being operators that profit off the transaction of ad placement, the measurement of response, and even the facilitation of payment.” In the piece, published last week, Wolff also bashes the “fake it til you make it” revenue models of big entrepreneurial publishers – but he seems mostly focused on BuzzFeed. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWz400A0ABD0080tL02P0Aq> .

Measure Twice... 

Twitter is tapping Datalogix and Acxiom to beef up its analytics dashboard. Now, “If you have conversion tracking enabled, campaign insights will tell you more about the users who have converted in the past. You can even compare insights between your reached and converted audiences to identify new ways to connect with an audience that is most likely to convert.” Blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/iB8W00BtPAL00A000Dq2A04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

The Huffington Most 

Speculation of a HuffPo spin-off percolated in the wake of Verizon’s AOL acquisition, but the company could bring value that’s hard to hand off. HuffPo has been a barometer of sorts for digital news, mastering SEO when most views came from Google searches and A/B headline testing when users moved to social media. The pub evidently offers a three-item native content deal to advertisers for $130,000. The NYT offers an interesting peek inside what one ex-staffer calls a “discombobulated chaos machine.” Among the story’s tidbits: 2014 revenue was $146 million, or about breakeven. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/jquB0t2LW004D0P0AAB0000> . 

Exeunt Costolo 

Wednesday marked Twitter CEO Dick Costolo’s last day on the job, and he shared some parting words with The Guardian on his way out. According to Costolo, Twitter’s IPO sparked shortsightedness. “When we took the company public, I had an expectation that the market would evaluate us based on our financial metrics first and foremost,” he said. “I probably would frame the way we were thinking about the future of the company differently, understanding how we were in retrospect evaluated.” Despite growing Twitter revenues 97% year on year to $1.7 billion, Costolo fielded much criticism for stalled user growth.

The Internet Of My Things 

As everyday goods like cars, kitchen appliances, brick-and-mortar retail and consumer-tech gadgets become more integrated with the digital world, brands see the potential for new consumer data sources. But balancing the high potential value of that data against consumers’ instinctive privacy concerns is a tough to navigate for many companies. Ad Age data editor Kate Kaye suggests all firms involved be more open with the public, as recent surveys show people are worried about connected devices collecting data. What’s needed may be education, not obfuscation. Read the full post at Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0DtA00w0D0AP00040> . 

Spotlight On Cross-Device 

MIT Technology Review dives into cross-device targeting with a detailed primer by Adam Tanner. The brave new world in cross-device linking is, of course, television. “Advertisers on the whole are cautiously approaching targeted TV commercials, even as many expect such ad personalization in the future. Industry officials say they want to turn up the temperature slowly on the frogs in the pot of advertising, lest they leap out and prod regulation.” But the accuracy of cross-device methodologies – especially probabilistic measurement – is up for debate.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Mission For Mars 

Speaking to The Drum, Mars Foods Global CMO Bruce McColl said the firm is looking to expand its ecommerce and programmatic efforts. The maker of brands like Snickers, Uncle Ben’s and M&Ms has already begun to embed buy buttons on its digital dealings, from social media campaigns to video placements. “The big change that’s happening now is the way people are shopping, and when you think about tailoring or starting to merge how you communicate with how people buy, then programmatic and the ability to individualize messages there start to get very exciting,” McColl said.

Spend For Sponsored 

Sponsored content startup Nativo raised a $20 million VC round on Tuesday, led by Advance Vixeid Partners. Nativo works with 350 publishers (including Time Inc., WebMD and TEN: The Enthusiast Network) and will use the funds to invest more resources into content distribution and to expand globally. The native content space is heating up as publishers like BuzzFeed and the NYT build sponsored content studios in-house and as brands seek distribution for their content marketing. Nativo’s funding comes just weeks after its competitor TripleLift raised $10.5 million. Nativo had previously raised $11.2 million to date. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/GsB0AT20DI4XW0AL0000P0q> . 

A Round For RadiumOne 

Speaking of funding, RadiumOne secured a $54 million round (50% equity, 50% debt), bringing its total financing to $87 million. RadiumOne will use the money to increase its investment in Activate, a self- and managed-service programmatic ad platform. “Marketers are continuing their march toward programmatic – not just with online, video and mobile display ads but with rich media formats as well,” said RadiumOne chief Bill Lonergan.

What’s ’Appening 

According to a Forrester survey released Monday, Google is no longer as reliant as it once was on mobile web usage. According to an opinion poll of 2,000 US smartphone users, Google has 12% of the app market, in terms of user time spent on its apps, compared to Facebook’s 13%. The long tail consists of Apple, Amazon, Yahoo and Microsoft, which combine to equal Google’s market share. But the real competition could come from messaging apps like Tencent’s WeChat, which have user bases that rival the social media giants. Read on at The WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPsZ0Tq0AD00B4K020W0> . 

Blocking The Blockers 

Shine, the Israeli company that has reportedly partnered with an (unnamed) European telco to preinstall ad-blocking software on mobile phones, penned an op-ed in Ad Age taking ad tech to task for trying to circumvent ad-blocking tech. Judging by the tone of this post – and the vitriol marketers and publishers have for ad blockers – this fight ain’t over. Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0s00UqM0> ..

Handling The Scroll

Facebook’s digital video has gone from nascent to powerhouse in a short timespan, and it is now refining its services for marketers in that department. For example, advertisers on the platform have previously paid for videos that were served to a newsfeed, but now Facebook is looking to introduce a cost-per-view model, which activates only when a certain metric is hit (such as unmuting a video or spending more time watching it). This gives marketers some breathing room over concerns that users are scrolling past ads, and it comes closer to YouTube’s offering, which only counts a view when a user watches for 30 seconds.
