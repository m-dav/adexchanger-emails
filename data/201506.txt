 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic Across The Pond 

Programmatic ad spend now takes nearly half (45%) of all display ad budgets in the UK, according to a study by the IAB and research consultancy MTM. The data shows programmatic display and video mobile ads doubled from 2013 to 2014, making programmatic advertising in the UK a $1.1 billion business. The increasing role of programmatic in video proves it’s “on advertising’s top table,” said Tim Elkington, chief strategy officer for the IAB. "Consequently, due to the rise in mobile and video ad spend, we estimate around 70 to 80% of all digital spend will be programmatic by 2018." Media Week has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LLi2VADP0s00A0> . 

Tools Of Engagement 

Video is top of mind for American ad agency execs, according to a May poll by Strata. Nearly seven in 10 agency sources said video is their main campaign focus in 2015. However, only 44% of respondents are confident in the ROI of digital video purchases. Targeting video ads based on consumers’ interest is a key draw according the findings, and nearly two-thirds of respondents cited targeted video advertising as the most effective way to capture consumers’ attention. But a separate study by Strata in April says humor, not targeted interests, is the best strategy for racking up video views. eMarketer has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPsj4B00W000qAL0020AWD> . 

Fine TUNE 

Mobile attribution player TUNE announced <http://go.adexchanger.com/gk0D40L0q20sBA0AW000XLP>  Tuesday that it would consolidate its paid, owned and earned measurement tools into a single hub – a sort of “mission control” for marketers working across different disciplines, said TUNE CEO Peter Hamilton. “Marketers want a unified experience regardless of whether they’re working with TUNE or with someone else,” Hamilton told AdExchanger. The console combines technology that TUNE brought on board through two recent acquisitions – MobileDevHQ <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pl40L0DYAsq2>  and app recommendation startup Appfuel. 

Search-enfreude 

Former FTC adviser Tim Wu, Harvard’s Michael Luca and the Yelp data science team published an academic paper on Monday that levels harsh accusations against Google’s search result practices. In particular, the authors take aim at Google for displaying its content and products more prominently in results. “By leveraging dominance in search to promote its internal content, Google is leaving consumers with lower quality results and worse matches,” they write. The addition of Wu, who’s written positively about Google in the past, is likely meant to counterbalance Yelp’s apparent partiality.

(Un)Privacy Policy 

RadioShack’s unsurprising bankruptcy this year resulted in a number of interesting legal cases regarding what happens to the firm’s data post-mortem. The New York Times revives those cases with an investigation into the privacy and security policies currently in place. Many companies, including leaders like Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and LinkedIn (and, ahem...the Times), have clauses that turn their respective datas ets into an open commodity if there’s “a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, asset sale or other transaction.” Read on at The NYT <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0L0P4qA02000WLn000AsDB> .

Tuning In To Automation 

Speaking to Radio Ink, OMD's US director of national audio investment, Natalie Swed, says programmatic advertising is helping radio stay relevant in the digital age. As more programmatic solutions flood the broadcast and digital markets, Swed says the industry is gearing up to transition into automation. “I think the timing was critical that it happened now, because people are starting to ask about programmatic in every medium,” she said. “The fact that radio can at least speak about it and say, ‘It's coming, we have a plan, there's a future, this is what's going to happen,’ is very important.” Read the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LLp22ADP0s00A0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Sorrell Has Spoken 

Late last week, WPP chief Martin Sorrell shared a dim view on the global ad market as a result of weak markets abroad. “Business is tough; it’s not easy,” Sorrell said during an interview at Cannes. “GDP forecasts have been taken down and so have advertising forecasts.” And according to Sorrell, the US market is “OK, but not vibrant.” But the worldwide ad market could grow by 1% next year, he added, thanks to the Olympic games and the US presidential election. And with $20 billion worth of ad spend up for review from large advertisers like L’Oréal, P&G and Coca-Cola, Sorrell sees opportunity in new accounts.

Man Vs. Machine 

A collection of the world’s biggest digital platforms, from Apple and LinkedIn to Snapchat and Instagram, have made recent decisions to bring on editors (and DJs). Whether it’s related to the upcoming elections or real-time trends, these social media companies see adding a human editorial touch as an important step in sourcing the best content on their platform. For Facebook and Google it’s a different story, as they can’t scale human teams to match the amount of content they have on hand. Check it out at Fortune <http://go.adexchanger.com/ysGWDqP00A0LABJ04h00020> . 

That’s A Wrap 

The WSJ puts a ribbon on Cannes, and the takeaway is that the industry’s flush with digital advertising platforms and formats. At the annual festival, firms showcased new formats, like Facebook’s smartphone-specific ad formats; publishers struck landmark partnerships, like Vice and Pinterest’s alliance; and next-gen agencies emerged (WPP, Snapchat and the Daily Mail launched a content agency called Truffle Pig). Virtual reality is also knocking on digital advertising’s door. “Digital has changed our industry completely,” said Publicis Groupe CEO Maurice Levy. “If you don’t change you are out of the picture.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/FsDBL00Ki0W0P2Gq000AA04> . 

Accidents Happen 

Google issued updates to its “confirmed clicks” mechanism late last week, in an attempt to boost display ad performance by weeding out accidental clicks. The three updates include blocking clicks that occur too close to the edge of an image, blocking clicks on app icons and an added click delay that only lets users click on ads several seconds after the page has loaded. This could help advertisers improve performance “by re-investing spend saved from accidental clicks back into their display campaigns,” the company said. Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0sjA0q0L0BAL0PDG2> . 

Adieu To Banner Ads? 

Adieu, a new browser extension, aims to upend the banner ad market by allowing viewers to choose images they like instead of branded content. Unlike other species of ad blockers, Adieu does cost the user money (it’s roughly $5 for 500 blocks). Part of Adieu’s “sell” to users is faster browsing speed and the ability to wall off marketers from your browsing data. Adieu said its product rewards the Internet’s good content (though with standard ad blockers, you can also white-list favored sites). Adweek has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02M000kG00sPW04DABAqL0> .

Taking The Lead 

For marketers, getting people to sign up for things (newsletters, direct mail, deals, memberships, etc.) is a necessary way to collect basic consumer data on a target audience. And the friction in a sign-up process, where users have to input standard info, sometimes over multiple forms, is a major hurdle. Facebook is looking to solve that for marketers within its garden, launching new “lead ads” that can auto-fill for that kind of registration data from Facebook’s own profile info.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

The Rush On Facebook 

Facebook’s latest ad offering, Lead Ads, aims to simplify the mobile signup process. The function populates data like email addresses from Facebook user profiles to increase registrations for newsletters, price estimates and follow-up calls. According to a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00zI0ALAWP9sB02q000> , “Advertisers may only use this information in accordance with their privacy policies, which we make available in the lead ad before people click submit. Advertisers are also restricted from reselling lead information to third parties.” Facebook is testing the format with a “small group” of businesses. Elsewhere, Facebook nabbed Yahoo’s chief cybersecurity officer, Alex Stamos, who will now act as Facebook’s chief security officer. Read Stamos’ post at Facebook <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPsJ0zq0AD00B4a020W0> . 

Rakuten Cozies Up To Krux 

Rakuten's taking audience segmentation more seriously by allowing advertisers to home in on its platform insights. The firm’s marketing arm, aptly dubbed Rakuten Marketing, announced on Thursday that it will use Krux’s DMP to improve on the data it uses for personalized marketing. Rakuten Marketing’s TV and video streaming service, Viki, which it acquired in 2013, is the first Rakuten property to leverage Krux’s data. Viki will also tap into Krux’s Audience Management solution to target new audiences that resemble engaged consumer segments. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0KzsWPb0A00> . 

The NYT Agency 

T Brand Studio, the content marketing arm of The New York Times, anticipates doubling its profit and revenue this year from where it stood in 2014. Capital NY estimates T Brand Studio accounted for between $12 million and $15 million last year, meaning the 2015 haul could be upwards of $30 million. With ongoing campaigns of between $250,000 and $500,000 and geared toward high-end advertisers, the content marketing shop is emerging as a crucial part of the Times’ digital revenue, as evidenced by a staffing binge from 10 to 37 in the past year. But the real question is: If the Times can do it, where does that leave agencies? Read on at Capital <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWL400c0ABD00z0sL02P0Aq> . 

Spot-On Acquisition 

Spotify snapped up data analytics firm Seed Scientific for an undisclosed sum. Previously, Seed Scientific ran data analytics for Spotify competitor Beats, which Apple acquired for $3 billion last year. Fortune reporter Jonathan Vanian points out that the buy makes sense for Spotify, as it looks to increase its ad revenue amid an ever-more-crowded music streaming space. The key to this buy is data analytics that go beyond recommending artists and playlists to Spotify users. “Correlating tons of data to better tailor ads to listeners’ tastes would definitely be welcome to Spotify’s advertisers and partners,” writes Vanian. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0s0MWD0L4Pd0A2q0z0BA00> . 

Meeting Demand 

IBM announced a new product dubbed Event Readiness on Thursday, which helps brands with surges in traffic and increases in demand. Those surges could either be anticipated (think: the holidays or special sales), or be the product of random spikes. Trey Seck, VP of client success at IBM Commerce, said the increasing marketing and commerce function of social media can also drive unexpected spikes. Event Readiness will help keep servers from crashing when running at capacity and sending customer alerts when items sell out.

Case In Point: Madonna 

Live Nation SVP of Digital Media Julia Heiser joined Facebook’s David Jakubowski onstage in Cannes to discuss how people-based marketing gels with the music firm’s advertising initiatives. The core argument is that as music consumption and concert ticket purchases increasingly occur on mobile, reaching consumers across devices is the key to conversion. Heiser offered a case study in which Live Nation used Atlas’ targeting tech to promote Madonna’s 2015 “Rebel Heart” tour that resulted in a 66% increase in ticket sales tied back to mobile. As a counterpoint, not everyone buys Facebook’s pitch <http://go.adexchanger.com/igzW00BsPPL00A000Dq2A04> . Read more via the Atlas Blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0sAAh0DQz00> . 

Good Luck, Gameloft 

Gameloft, a video game developer and publisher based in France, has made a series of unorthodox changes to its advertising model. The company is taking its gamers’ data and profiles, plus what it can glean from Google Play and Facebook Connect, to attract brands. Notably, the developer has also eschewed programmatic networks in favor of a highly personalized auction, which Gameloft hosts itself. The firm is also providing native ad formats, worked out through direct deals with marketers. The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0sAAi0DRz00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Cannes, Cont. 

Cannes coverage continues with a piece by the WSJ’s Jack Marshall, who debunks the idea that ad tech has usurped the celebration of creativity that the festival was build on. The truth isn’t that ad tech is taking over, according to Marshall, but rather that advertising is becoming more digital by the day. And as the nature of digital players change, advertising evolves with it. “AppNexus is at Cannes because it’s the epicenter of digital advertising innovation and conversation,” AppNexus CEO Brian O’Kelley told the Journal. “Snapchat isn’t ad tech, nor is Daily Mail – but they are representative of the future of advertising.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DsBqA0020P0W9Avw00> . 

More Partners For Placed 

Location insights firm Placed inked eight new partnerships on Wednesday, in addition to issuing two patents on location measurement and validation. RadiumOne, Samba TV, Tremor Video, 4INFO and GumGum are among the new firms using Placed Attribution to measure how their ads impact retail activity. “Placed Attribution enables GumGum to connect in-image and in-screen advertising to store visit, delivering an accurate and complete view on the impact of digital advertising on store visits," explained Ben Plomion, SVP of marketing at GumGum. See the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/qsAW0A0DLx004v02B0Pa00q>  and read more via Street Fight <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0sy0B4L0b2AAP00q0Dv00> . 

Google Play Music’s Makeover 

Google debuted its remodeled music streaming service, Google Play Music, in a bid for digital audio ad budgets. But it will have to compete with Spotify, Pandora and Apple’s impending service to earn a spot at the table. Adweek reporter Lauren Johnson points out how Google’s take on music streaming could disrupt the current Internet radio ad market. For one, Google’s got search and email data that competitors lack. “If Google is able to weave Google Play Music with the technology that powers the world's most dominant search engine, it has a chance to distinguish itself against the long list of smaller online music companies also trying to crack music discovery,” Johnson writes. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0szA0000q0Dc20LAWv> . 

Broadly Speaking 

Unilever and Vice are preparing ad campaigns to populate the media company’s upcoming female-focused channel, Broadly. The partnership was announced at Cannes by Unilever CMO Keith Weed and Vice Chief Creative Director Eddy Moretti. Unilever got in on the ground floor of Vice five years ago with a series of Axe promotions, but the mega-brand is particularly interested in Broadly, as 77% of Unilever products are purchased by women. Content will be developed by the two companies for YouTube and Vice’s own online channels. Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/ud0000DB4L0A0A02vPqWAs0> . 

The Qwilt Bundle 

Qwilt, a company that makes networking equipment to enable online video for firms like Time Warner Cable and Comcast, announced on Wednesday a Series D funding round of $25 million, bringing the startup’s total funding to $65 million. This round was led by Disrupt-ive, and includes continued investments from Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and Cisco’s investment arm. Video content already accounts for two-thirds of all Internet traffic and is growing fast. Companies like Qwilt that enable service providers to distribute content without clogging network pipes, which Qwilt does by deploying on hardware at the neighborhood level, are in a strong position.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Done Deal 

Verizon’s behemoth $4.4 billion AOL acquisition closed on Tuesday, less than two months after the takeover was announced. On a call with press, Verizon EVP Marni Walden shared two key updates. Bob Toohey, president of Verizon Digital Media Services, will now report to AOL chief Tim Armstrong. Cursory details about a mobile-first video product slated to surface this summer were also revealed. “Ad-supported data is part of the offering,” Walden said. The product will focus on live, emerging and on-demand content. While it will work across networks and on Wi-Fi in the US, it “will work best when it’s on Verizon networks,” Walden said. Read on via the NYT <http://go.adexchanger.com/gD0D40L0q20sBA0AW000VqP> . 

M&A In The EU 

Multiple acquisitions hit the wire Tuesday in the European digital consulting space, as Accenture purchased Brightstep <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PWBED000qA2q04L0s> , a Swedish content and commerce agency, and Publicis Groupe’s Starcom MediaVest Group purchased AKOM360 <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWq4sA00XL0PB0F2> , a German digital marketing and content agency. Considering the eurozone has outperformed researchers’ expectations  <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPsG4B00W000qAq0020AYD> in digital marketing performance, it should come as no surprise that consultancies with strong regional roots are being shopped around. 

Programmatic Revolution 

The programmatic advertising ecosystem is rubbing off on marketing, according to Harvard Business School senior lecturer Jeffrey Rayport. “Is advertising a bellwether for all of marketing?” asks Rayport. “If so, we will soon see a comprehensive array of marketing functions transformed by programmatic techniques.” When mar tech takes hold, enterprise software systems will add rigor to ROMI (return on marketing investment) metrics and increase the efficiency of campaign planning and bidding. And that ROI focus will bring CFOs and CMOs closer together. Harvard Business Review has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PZBHD000qA2q04L0s> . 

From Digital To Edible Cookies 

Mondelez International has renewed its marketing content deal with Facebook, citing a need to “exploit the fastest growing consumer behaviours,” which are video consumption and mobile commerce. Mondelez, one of the world’s largest packaged-foods firms, wants to convince consumers to make more impulse buys online or via mobile. They can solve for frictionless payment processing all they want, but consumers are deterred by a lack of instant gratification when they add Oreos to their online shopping cart. The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00IWqA000sPqA00040D2L> . 

All Aboard The Techie Yacht 

Cannes is a harbinger for the marketing and advertising industries, and its traditional roster of creative agencies has shifted more toward ad tech companies. Following the big SIlicon Valley platforms, ad tech companies hit the beach in force last year, and now it appears to be the year of cloud marketers. Adobe, Oracle and Salesforce are busy at the festival. Evidently, now “Cannes is less about hosting Kardashian-filled yacht parties, and more about detailed informational seminars.” Read more at The WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0s0JWD0L4P10A2q0q0BA00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Snapchat’s Spiegel At Cannes 

As industry execs flock to France for Cannes Lions, all eyes landed on Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, who was interviewed onstage Monday by Cosmopolitan magazine editor Joanna Coles. Spiegel took a dim view of targeted advertising, adding that “not being creepy” is a top priority for the ephemeral messaging firm. Snapchat’s solution to the “creep factor” is 3V Advertising, a new ad offering that plays vertical video ads on Snapchat’s “Stories,” or aggregations of user photos and videos curated by Snapchat. The ads will leverage some data, like geolocation for targeting, but will largely be curated by Snapchat’s editors. More via VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tw0Wk0P0s000DBk20L4qAA0> . 

A New Shark In A Crowded Tank 

Microsoft’s EVP and CSO, Mark Penn, is leaving the company to form a private equity firm that will focus on investments in digital marketing services. The fund, Stagwell Group LLC, will hit the ground with $250 million to play with (it helps when Steve Ballmer, who has a net worth north of $20 billion, is “a core investor”), and “the capacity to use leverage to make up to $750 million in acquisitions.” Read more at the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqxP04A0LB0WAk02s0000lD> . 

Insta Targeting 

Facebook is gearing up to let marketers tap its suite of targeting tools on Instagram, Bloomberg <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000y2040qAsLPDBkm0WA0>  reports. Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s VP of global marketing solutions, said Facebook is working toward a streamlined buying process that could help advertisers buy across both platforms. But the focus for now is increasing targeting capabilities on the photo sharing platform, which “should deliver a better return on investment because the marketer is actually reaching someone who is interested,” Everson said. Facebook is expected to pitch its plans for Instagram to agency partners and clients this week at Cannes. 

The Decision For Dorsey 

In a prepared statement released Monday morning, Twitter’s board sent a crystal-clear message to the company’s co-founder and interim CEO, Jack Dorsey: Choose Square or choose Twitter. Dorsey, who is taking the reins from Dick Costolo on July 1, is CEO of digital payment company Square. In no uncertain terms, the board of directors wrote, “The Committee will only consider candidates for recommendation to the full Board who are in a position to make a full-time commitment to Twitter.” For Twitter’s next chief, it’s all or nothing. Read the statement <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DnA02000BWk0q4szLP0A> . 

Brands Gotta Feed 

According to social analytics firm Shareablee, brands are not taking full advantage of user engagement with branded content on social media. According to the data, Americans engaged with branded content 52% more often in Q1 2015 than in Q1 2014. On Twitter, for instance, the average number of posts per brand went up 16%, but engagement per post went up 32%. Not to mention Instagram’s consumer engagement, which went up more than 20 times the rate of Twitter’s. Social media is a fertile marketing field.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Personalization in Cannes 

The Cannes Lions ad festival provides a nice backdrop to reflect on what creativity should like in the data-rich future. Havas London tech head Michael Olaye tells Campaign, “First we saw smart data for segmentation, then came ‘targeted’ programmatic ads, and now we have the technology in place to deliver individualisation – which actually impacts directly on the creative thought process from inception to execution.” Data-driven storytelling: Is it real? Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/jq6B0s2LW004D0P0AAZ0f00>  More on ad tech at Cannes <http://go.adexchanger.com/qsAW0A0DL8004g02B0P000q> . 

Techie Agency 

Ad Age questions Havas’ former global CEO, David Jones, on his latest “brand tech” venture. The firm, called You & Mr. Jones, offers content creation, brand strategy, social media marketing, programmatic media buying and data analytics, and has already wrangled some big-name clients like Coca-Cola, Unilever, Chevrolet, Guinness, Nestlé, Pepsi, PlayStation, American Express and AT&T. “The world today has big company groups who are fantastic at brands, but not as good at tech, or tech companies who are either not interested in brands or not experts at it,” Jones said. “The majority of global brands need help from someone who gets both.” Read the full interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00s01g0W9DP0L0A00> . 

Do Not Call Evolves 

The FCC moved to give consumers more control over how marketers can reach them via text messaging and calls for both landline and wireless phones. The law lets phone carriers block robocalls and automated texting at the request of consumers, tightening current “Do Not Call” legislation and further boxing advertisers out of telecommunicating with audiences. The new rule would also restrict marketers from contacting consumers in the event of a new telephone number. More via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/qsAW0A0DLa004g02B0P200q> . As phone numbers give way to app connections, will it matter? 

Mobile Rubicon 

Rubicon Project claims mobile revenue grew more than 1,300% in the last two years and is on track to contribute $200 million (more than 20%) of the company’s total “managed” (i.e., gross) revenue for this year. According to the press release, the company now plugs into inventory on more than 17,000 apps. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/o023000bg00sPW04DABAqL0> .

*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/l8BqX000LsDP0A2A4000X0W> The Rise Of 'Header Bidding' And The End Of The Publisher Waterfall "Header bidding levels the waterfall such that buyers and exchanges first submit real-time bids, before direct buys are fed to the ad server. Publishers have the option to let any exchange beat a direct-sold impression. And pitting exchange bids against each other drives up the second-price auction..."

*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0ZsA00Z8D0AP00040> Pinterest Pulls The Trigger On Its Ads API "Twitter is great for discussing trending news and opinion and Facebook is great for catching up with friends, but Pinterest is somehow more aligned in an intrinsic way with consumers looking for something and then buying it,” Don Mathis, CEO of Kinetic Social, said. “Consumers are starting to use this platform almost like a form of ecommerce search..."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Kickback Echo Chamber 

Writing for Ad Age, 4As CEO Nancy Hill explains why the organization has formed a task force to tackle the thorny issue of media rebates. Speculation has fueled the debacle, according to Hill, but she sees an opportunity to revisit and define what transparency and trust means to the industry. “Our industry reflects many perspectives, and the task force will work to better communicate those views between agency and client,” she writes. “We expect to issue new best practices and guidelines resulting from this work within the next few weeks.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/GsB0A920D544W0AL0000P0q> . 

Consolidating OTT Data 

Innovid, an online video ad provider, has partnered with Roku to produce a new ad format for the OTT TV service. The ads have already rolled out on Crackle, CBS and VEVO’s Roku channels, and they enable marketers to add quizzes, games and retail sales, as well as to connect with smartphones via SMS. Roku is using this new ad, which is exclusive to the platform and built directly into its software development kit, and a recent partnership with Nielsen <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0s009q65>  to bring more precise analytics to its data science and advertising teams. TechCrunch has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP06702q0L0AB0Ds00A94> . 

Dark Podcasting 

The NYT’s Farhad Manjoo takes a deep dive on the Podcast boom and the ad biz that backs the medium. Podcast ads are effective, according to Ryan Stansky, marketing manager for Squarespace, which is one of the most prevalent podcast sponsors, but Stansky says that a lack of standards is fueling mistrust between advertisers and podcasters. “I’ve heard directly from sales reps in casual settings that [audience] numbers get lied about,” he said. “To me, that’s the most scary part of it all: that you’re paying for something that you’re not actually getting.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0790Ls0DB080W0q4P20A0A> . 

Digital Pulse Check 

In May, digital advertising and OOH drove 2% growth in the ad market, according to data from Standard Media Index. Last month, digital jumped 24% YoY, with nearly half of all digital budgets spent programmatically. “Digital continues to surge at the expense of other media,” said SMI’s chief commercial officer, James Fennessy. “Digital video continues to grow, and as audience measurement on mobile devices improves, we are confident that these gains will accelerate and positively impact the spend going to the major networks.” Read the  <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq08sA0099D0AP00040> press release.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Blocking, Tackling 

The rise of ad blocking, the ad sector’s bogeyman of the month, sparked a think piece co-authored by two of the agency world’s biggest wigs. GroupM’s Rob Norman and John Montgomery write, “If advertisers pay only for viewable ads or buy media on a cost per action basis this won't affect them in the short term other than creating constrained supply. But if Adblocking becomes a profitable business it has every opportunity of undermining the current ad-supported content model on the web.” Apple developers, you listening? More <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02I000C200sPW04DABAqL0> . 

Adobe Reports 

In disclosing its Q2 numbers, Adobe reported strong 15% growth for its marketing cloud. Adobe continues to push forward with its ad stack, having just bought dynamic creative optimization player Tumri and finished a big integration with Microsoft's Dynamics CRM. Read transcript at Seeking Alpha <http://go.adexchanger.com/GsB0A220DD4JW0AL0000P0q> . 

Video Gets Personal 

Eyeview and Nielsen debuted personalized video ad delivery based on consumer shopping behavior. Eyeview’s tech draws on transaction data, demographics, location, local pricing and weather to serve digital video ads at the household level, while Nielsen will measure incremental sales results. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPsK02q0AD00B4E020W0> . An Eyeview spokesperson said six brands are using the solution in beta but didn't name names. 

Serial In Cannes 

“Serial,” the 2014 podcast that obliterated industry precedents with 86 million downloads and a Peabody Award, will be hunting for marketing partners in Cannes next week. Despite being produced by WBEZ Chicago, a public radio station, “Serial” is not underwritten like a typical public radio program. Read on at Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/l2BqF000LsDP0A2A4000L0W> . Will podcasting be the last hand-sold digital media format?

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

It’s An Autoplay World 

Following in the footsteps of Facebook and Google, who took some blows while paving the road to user acceptance of autoplay video ads, Twitter announced <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0rB0B4L0M2AAP00q0DY00>  Tuesday that it will debut its own digital video format with a baked-in viewability guarantee. For Twitter, that means videos will be 100% in-view for three consecutive seconds. The ads will autoplay whenever a user comes to rest on a video while scrolling the social media feed, and will apply to all video content uploaded to Twitter, such as GIFs and Vines. “We have learned just showing a thumbnail with a play button isn’t enough to entice consumers,” said Adam Bain, Twitter’s president of revenue and partnerships (who might be a candidate for the recently-vacated CEO position, according to Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0YA0DB0WN2Lq00rA00C4P0> ). Check it out at The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/AY0D04WB200ArPq00L0O0DA> . 

AOL Gets Crafty 

AOL has debuted an internal content creation division dubbed Partner Studios. The division will churn out banner and branded videos ads and manage the distribution of that content across AOL’s digital properties. Georgia-Pacific, Partner Studio’s first client, is working with AOL to promote six of its brands, including Angel Soft, Brawny and Dixie. Considering advertisers in the US will spend $4.3 billion on native ads this year, per eMarketer’s estimates, content creation is hotter than ever. “We see this as that next high-growth sector in the industry,” AOL CMO Allie Kline tells Ad Age. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0PrA00EYD0AP00040> . 

McSnaps 

In its latest ad offering to brands, Snapchat is making its geofilter digital stickers available to brands. The ephemeral messaging platform’s some 100 million daily users incorporate digital sticker overlays onto snaps to communicate their current location to friends, and now brands can do the same. McDonald’s is the first brand to trial the location-centric stickers. Users can now decorate their messages with McDonald’s-themed graphics from any restaurant location in the US. Read on via LA Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLYWQ0APrF020qD40> . 

Price Checkers Consolidate 

Connexity, Shopzilla’s parent company, snapped up PriceGrabber for an undisclosed sum on Tuesday. PriceGrabber’s core service offers comparison shopping, but the firm also provides data to retailers and merchants, as well as to AOL, Bing, Comcast and Yahoo. The price-aggregation space has seen a consolidation in recent months, including Connexity’s Become acquisition some six months ago. “Together the combined company will be one of the world’s largest sources of high-intent shopping leads that result in over $2 billion in annual sales for retailers and brands,” Connexity says in a press release.

Better Off Paid 

A report released <http://go.adexchanger.com/qrAW0A0DLH004Y02B0PS00q>  from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism documents some of the trends affecting the digital media world, including the rise of video and social media as a tectonic force in modern journalism. The report also documents a surprisingly high percentage of consumers who say they felt “disappointed or deceived” by sites that produce sponsored content. However, sponsored content does remain the bread and butter for some of the news industry’s fastest-growing brands, and BuzzFeed has indicated it gets better views and engagement on sponsored posts.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Lévy Bursts 

Writing for The Drum, Publicis Groupe chief Maurice Lévy pens a consumer-first think piece on data mining. “The consumer could rightfully ask ‘it’s my information, why should anyone else make money out of it?’ and claim for a share of the associated revenues,” Lévy writes. “Some startups already offer value for personal data. Though the internet model is built on advertising and data collection for (mainly) free services, it doesn’t mean that companies should be the only beneficiaries.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LSI2rADP0r00A0> . 

TV Tech Merger 

Extreme Reach, a video ad delivery company, will buy TV ad services provider Talent Partners in an equity and debt deal. Talent Partners monitors TV networks to help advertisers and agencies place and measure TV and digital ads and manage royalties. As Extreme Reach CEO John Roland tells the WSJ, TV marketers have long had tools to understand how actors, artists and musicians receive royalties from TV advertising, but connecting those compensation models to digital transactions is more complex. “As the digital market grows, the talent isn’t going to want to get one flat fee when that commercial could be running 10 billion times,” Roland said. Read on. <http://go.adexchanger.com/lSBqs000LrDP0A2A4000J0W>  

Gannett Shutters Blinq 

Blinq Media, the social ads company acquired by Gannett three years ago for an estimated $40 million, has shut down. Atlanta Business Chronicle reports, “BLiNQ’s remaining roughly 30 employees were informed of the shutdown at an abruptly called meeting May 27, where they were offered severance packages, according to a source.” Story. <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0rtA0q0K0BAL0PDS2>  It was just two years ago that Blinq boasted 60 employees and a plan to align Blinq with Gannett’s local circular. AdExchanger coverage. <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWL400u0ABD00S0rL02P0Aq>  More trouble in PMD paradise. 

TV Down Under 

Australia’s Multi Channel Network (MCN) launched a private marketplace for linear TV ad buying in the  $4 billion TV ad market. About 1% (or $40 million) of MCN’s TV revenue went through the platform in May, and the company expects that volume to grow to 5% by the end of the year. If true, that means buyers will transact $200 million in Aussie “programmatic” TV this year. MediaPost has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00MWqA000rPSA0v040D2L> . 

Europe’s Privacy Barbs 

The Belgian Privacy Commission, a European privacy watchdog group, is dragging Facebook to court over the data collection enabled by its plug-in network. Market competitiveness underlies heightened consumer privacy concerns that American tech firms are facing in Europe. According to a Quartz <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LSN2wADP0r00A0>  report Monday, Facebook is worth more than all of European tech’s $1 billion-plus companies combined. Tech.eu has the full story <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4S0x0P00qD002LBW0OAr> .

Stalled Buy Buttons 

Buy buttons might be the new “must have” for social platforms, but speed bumps loom, as Re/code’s Jason Del Rey reports. Integrating inventory and payment systems from retailers is just one of the many challenges Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest could face with click-to-purchase functionality, according to Del Rey. And while Twitter and Facebook have a jump on other social networks, neither firm is advancing its buttons at full tilt quite yet. Full story at Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0QSrWPz0A00> . 

Kids Come To Cannes 

In the run-up to a presentation at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Snapchat chief Evan Spiegel is gunning for brand dollars. He tells Adweek Snapchat’s privacy policy means the company doesn’t collect the kind of user data Facebook has at its disposal, pinning that fact as an opportunity for brands to avoid “the creepy factor.” "We're going to stay away from building really extensive profiles on people because that's just bad and doesn't feel very good,” he said.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Liberté, Égalité, Right To Be Forgotten 

Regulations from the EU aimed at US tech firms are at an all-time high, and tensions heightened Friday when France’s data protection regulator ordered Google to apply Europe’s right to be forgotten globally. “For delisting to be effective, it must be worldwide,” explained Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin. “It is a question of principle. Google must respect the rights of European citizens.” The order echoes a broader battle between the EU and US tech firms Facebook, Google and Amazon over anti-competition violations, taxes and tracking. More via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0OA0DB0We2Lq00rA00T4P0> . 

Twitchy Launch 

Google unveiled “YouTube Gaming” on Friday, a direct confrontation with Twitch, which unearthed a sizable market in streaming video chat rooms and services for gamers. It’s worth remembering Google was reportedly near a deal to acquire Twitch when Amazon scooped it up for just under $1 billion. The Verge reports, “You can monetize the streams through ads (including midroll ads) and fan funding.” It remains to be seen if Google can emulate the user loyalty Twitch has garnered in the difficult young, male demo.

Agency Review Maelstrom 

Morgan Stanley estimates the flurry of media agency reviews this summer means as much as $26 billion in global spend is up for grabs. The WSJ says there is  “more money hanging in the balance than the amount under review during the last three years combined.” On the upside for agencies, the jaw-dropping sum is still a small fraction of overall spending and revenue, and agencies will be pushing for higher volume and spending targeted on high-impact channels, to make up for deflated margins. Read on. <http://go.adexchanger.com/iVOW00BrPgL00A000Dq2A04>  

Condé Nast On Native 

Condé Nast’s Pat Connolly, VP of marketing solutions, talked with eMarketer about the publisher’s branded content studio, 23 Stories. According to Connolly, the uses of native are limited but powerful. “There will never be a shortage of inventory [and] there will never be a shortage of exposure or contact points,” Connally said. There is, however, a shortage of attention. The challenge for advertisers is to make sponsored content that’s as or more compelling than the content it competes with.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Havas In The Hot Seat 

Ad Age has obtained a contract template from two anonymous ad tech vendors who say they received the document from Havas Media US during deal negotiations. According to the sources, the contract mandates fees due to a Havas entity in Spain, based on the volume of business between the vendors and Havas. In an interview with Ad Age, Havas Media Group Global Managing Director Dominique Delport asserts, “It has nothing to do with rebates.” According to Delport, the Havas entity in Spain, which is called HM Alliance, is “one of the 150 legal entities that is in Havas,” and provides “digital campaign management and audience planning services and auditing.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DaA02000BWH0q4rILP0A> . 

Dwindling VC 

The Wall Street Journal visits the topic of declining VC interest in ad tech. Venky Ganesan, managing director at Menlo Partners, claims fundraising for ad tech firms has “almost evaporated,” and startups are struggling to land meetings. “Ad tech is full of the living dead,” added Ashu Garg, general partner of Foundation Capital, alluding to ad tech firms that can produce $30 million-$50 million in revenue but are unable to expand. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqJB0r2LW004D0P0AAb0H00>  The VC doldrums are driving a push for profitability at many companies.

Adblock Battles 

The hunted has become the hunter. Eyeo, maker of Adblock Plus, is speaking out against forthcoming features for Apple’s mobile operating system. The Apple update, announced at its developer conference on Monday, will equip iOS 9 iPhones and iPads with built-in ad blocking tech. The hiccup for Adblock Plus is that though the firm works to block ads, it has also built a business on white labeling some advertisers. “So far very little is known about content blocking extensions, available in Safari 9 and iOS 9,” said Ben Williams, head of operations for Adblock Plus. “We look nervously at how powerful their block lists will be.” Read on via The Guardian <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqLP04A0LB0WAH02r0000dD> . 

Season Of The Bot 

There’s been considerable sound and fury regarding the spread of bots, malware and viewability technology, but to what end? Based on research from Distil Networks, eMarketer writes <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40e0A2H0BMLD0WrP00q0A0>  that in 2014, “The share of web traffic worldwide coming from humans dropped from 54.8% to 40.9%.” It’s important to note that a significant portion of the bot traffic comes from “good bots” (aka non-malicious bots, such as apps for web crawling or search indexing, which register as traffic). Digital publishers, of course, registered the most damage from “bad bots.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

No Longer Emerging Markets 

In a look at Facebook’s international ambitions, Reuters reports that Europe is the company’s slowest-growing market, while Asia is its fastest-growing. Facebook is building products specifically for Asian markets, including India, and sees the expanding of regional advertisers to Western markets as a big opportunity. According to its head of marketing, Carolyn Everson, "The next 1 billion consumers are going to come from these countries." International contributed 51% of Facebook’s ad revenue in Q1. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/GrB0AC20DR4oW0AL0000P0q>  

Twitter’s Targeting Update 

Twitter added some targeting capabilities for mobile app marketers. With installed app targeting, Twitter hopes to help advertisers reach users based on the types of apps already installed on their devices. Financial services app Acorns is one firm trying it out. According to marketing director Sami Khan, “We are now able to combine not only what users are talking about but focus on those that have already-relevant apps on their phones, thus making our ad dollars even more efficient.” Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqSB0r2LW004D0P0AAp0C00> . 

Lies, Damn Lies And Self-Reported Financials 

Rubicon Project got some unwanted attention in a WSJ story on the sometimes large discrepancies between startup braggadocio and post-IPO reality. Back in 2010, the company claimed profitability and forecast a $200 million run rate for 2011, but later, disclosures revealed just $37.1 million in revenue during 2011 and a net loss of $15.4 million. According to the Journal, “Todd Tappin, Rubicon’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer, says it was common in 2010 for advertising technology companies to cite numbers that reflected all the ad transactions made on their networks.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/iTCW00BrPqL00A000Dq2A04>  

IPO For Quantcast? 

Quantcast tapped Stephen Collins, an experienced digital ad CFO, to run its financials. Perhaps best known for having overseen DoubleClick’s financials in the run up to its IPO, Collins was also CEO at Bazaarvoice when an FTC lawsuit forced the company to undo its acquisition of PowerReviews. More in the release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00rWqA000rPCA0U040D2L>  

Music’s Booming Market Cap 

On the heels of a $526 million round, Bloomberg reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00CA0L0Ds00rB2qW0AVP04>  that Spotify is now valued at a whopping $8.5 billion. Spotify is ramping up its content offering as it braces for the impact of Apple’s newly debuted music streaming service, which surfaced Monday at the Apple developer conference. The good news for Spotify is that its user base is growing at a quick clip; paid subscribers have increased by 33% since the end of 2014. The company is moving slowly on targeted ads. A future revenue lever, perhaps?

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

WPP Chairman: Digital Drives Agency Reviews 

Speaking at WPP’s annual shareholder meeting, the ad giant’s chairman said the shift to digital is driving the agency review trend. Philip Lader’s exact words were that the reviews are due to clients’ desires to “optimize their media spending in an increasingly digital media environment.” Said another way, some of the largest advertisers, among them P&G, Mondelez, Unilever and General Mills, are looking to use digital channels and strategies to do more with smaller marketing budgets. “Media agencies are also facing heightened scrutiny over the transparency of their practices and compensation,” as WSJ reporter Nathalie Tadena points out. It’s a tough time for agencies. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0yA0DB0WM2Lq00rA00b4P0> . 

AOL Buys Velos 

AOL snapped up predictive analytics firm Velos, only to immediately shutter the startup’s services. Velos, formerly Sociocast Networks, helps companies manage data and run predictive modeling. Though Velos founder Albert Azout updated his LinkedIn page in March, the AOL deal wasn’t formally announced until Tuesday. More data for Verizon. VentureBeat has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqcB0r2LW004D0P0AAN0y00> . 

The Programmatic Circuit 

The programmatic TV industry is fundamentally difficult to expand, seeing as upwards of 80% of TV advertising is sold by the networks at the yearly upfronts. But 20% of TV advertising is more than just scraps. The Drum talks to TubeMogul CMO Keith Eadie about what his company and WideOrbit are doing to educate the industry. One issue is that traditionally, “Digital and TV buyers have operated in silos and spoken different languages.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4y0d0P00qD002LBW0OAr>  

The Price Of Ad Blocking 

Ad blocking poses a threat to digital advertising, but how much do big advertisers and platforms stand to lose? PageFair draws on a number of data sources to estimate how much revenue Google, Bing and other publishers are losing thanks to ad blocking tech. The firm estimates that ad blocking tech in the US cost Google $1.9 billion in 2014, which reflects the 10% of users accessing Google’s digital properties who had an ad blocker installed on their browser. Sean Blanchfield, PageFair CEO, tells MediaPost that with white labeling available to large players, “It’s a bit of a murky world with pirates battling pirates.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00yP0ALAWPerB02q000> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Can You Hear Me Now? 

As Facebook ramps up its video ad efforts, marketers are learning how to develop content for the platform on the fly. But they have only a few seconds of soundless video with which to seize consumer attention. The WSJ quotes <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0FsrWPY0A00>  Adam Wohl, executive creative director at mcgarrybowen, who says, “You’ve got someone scrolling over the thing, and you’ve got to grab them by the throat quickly.” But as Facebook makes the rules, some agencies are looking to play along. SapientNitro, for example, is hosting internal classes on soundless video marketing. BuzzFeed Motion Pictures President Ze Frank weighs in too. 

Connected CPGs 

Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PZDsA40LrB00GA>  that Evrythng, an IoT company, is partnering with digital ad firm Trueffect to help target ads in the world of connected devices. The firms have connected their platforms via an API integration to gather info on how consumers interact with products. According to Martin Smith, SVP of solutions and development for Trueffect, consumer privacy will be respected though a new set of permission processes. “The cost of being on the packaging is now getting to a point where it's scalable," he said. 

Making Millennials Look Old 

Jared Allgood, the co-founder of messaging app Jott, says the service doubled its user base to half a million users this year and is seeing that figure grow by a factor of 15,000 to 20,000 users per day. Jott is unique in that it requires no Wi-Fi connection or data plan, although messaging on the platform is limited to certain geographic areas. The result, according to  <http://go.adexchanger.com/m000002040qArLPDBsH0WA0> TechCrunch, is that junior high and high schoolers are using the app to text at school without using data or Internet, and that “87 percent of teens text daily, compared to 61 percent of those who say they use Facebook, the next most popular choice.” For marketers looking to target teens, those numbers matter. 

Apple Hits Play On Music Service 

During Apple’s developer conference on Monday, Apple confirmed its long-rumored music service that will compete with Spotify, Pandora and others. Little information was shared about Apple’s ad plans on the platform, but it could mimic Spotify’s ad delivery to non-subscribers. "Apple is arriving late to the music streaming business,” Forrester analyst James McQuivey told The Verge <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0r00sq1I> . “But the writing is on the wall: digital downloads don't make sense for consumers that are connected wherever they go." 

Netflix’s Ad Barrier 

Netflix competitors such as Hulu and Amazon Prime have always featured lucrative ad revenue streams. Netflix didn’t integrate advertising early on, and CheatSheet reporter Nick Cannata-Bowman writes that may have been a mistake. “[Netflix] is stuck with their current offering; change now and they risk alienating an entire customer base that’s become accustomed to streaming free of ads,” he writes.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Amazon’s Bot Involvement 

Some fraudsters are using Amazon’s cloud to create and drive bot traffic across the web. As Jack Marshall reports for The Wall Street Journal, Fraudlogix uncovered the malware by measuring 2 billion ad impressions delivered to 64 million IP addresses in March and April , then comparing those impressions to its fraud database. According to the findings, Amazon’s servers made up 7.7% of fraudulent IP addresses. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0r08WD0L4Pn0A2q0o0BA00> . 

Apple Tax Shakeup 

Apple plans to nix the 30% fee it has charged media companies since 2003 on subscriptions bought through the App Store, sources tell the Financial Times. The shift comes as other tech giants like Google, Facebook and Snapchat begin hosting more content from publishers on their platforms. “While the new deal could mean Apple forfeits hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues from in-app payments every year, it could also assuage regulators anxious about its power over content companies,” reports FT reporters Tim Bradshaw and Shannon Bond. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00D9A02000BWo0q4roLP0A> . Related Apple news: Fewer than a quarter of the top 96 US retailers support Apple Pay. ”One of the biggest concerns is data control," said Mario De Armas, senior director for Wal-Mart. More in Reuters. <http://go.adexchanger.com/qrAW0A0DLp004o02B0Pa00q>  

Much Atweet About Nothing 

Chris Sacca, an early and vocal Twitter investor, wrote an 8,500-word blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0rAAq0Dbo00>  on the company that has unleashed a flood of ink regarding the social media platform’s future. Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/yroWDqP00A0LABc04r00020>  fills in some color on the commerce side, as Sacca doesn’t note in his post that Twitter’s head of commerce, former Ticketmaster CEO Nathan Hubbard, is a good friend. Hubbard has been in the position almost two years, and we’re seeing Twitter’s commerce features start to emerge from beta (or into a public beta stage, at least). Re/code notes as well that Sacca also “recommends, naturally, that Twitter acquire a startup, Rex, in which – surprise! – he’s an investor.” 

Mobile Alliance 

Video streaming platform Viewster partnered with mobile video ad platform AerServe to make Viewster’s video library available to advertisers. “Our audience of young pop culture fans increasingly accesses our service via mobile devices,” said Viewster chief Kai Henniges.   As Viewster’s business continues to grow, it was important for us to not only optimize our mobile offering, but to find a monetization partner that could really scale with us.” According to the firms, the partnership boosted revenue 80%.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Yet Another Telco Merger 

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: A telco and broadcaster are looking to hook up <http://go.adexchanger.com/yrdWDqP00A0LAB404800020> . This time, it’s T-Mobile hoping to tie the knot with Dish Network. Federal regulators can attend that wedding after they’re done ministering the AT&T/DirecTV and Charter Communications/Time Warner nuptials. According to The Wall Street Journal, the merged company will have Dish CEO Charlie Ergen as company chairman and T-Mobile chief John Legere as CEO. The other important aspect of the merger – the money part – is much less defined and still in a “formative stage,” according to a WSJ source. 

Investing In Recs 

DailyMail.com is betting on content recommendation with a $3 million investment in Taboola. Taboola, currently in a turf war with archrival Outbrain, received $117 million in funding from investors earlier this year. Though Daily Mail America CEO Jon Steinberg had hoped to strike an exclusive partnership with the content rec firm, that effort was a non-starter. “This money is a kind of handshake that we think won’t move [the] needle for them or us [immediately] but over time will deliver an economic return,” Steinberg  <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0r05WD0L4P90A2q0d0BA00> told the WSJ. Steinberg also alluded to future collaborative plans to develop a native video ad unit. Taboola chief Adam Singolda said his firm has promoted more than 3 million pieces of sponsored content. 

Data Mining Tug-Of-War 

According to data from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, consumers dislike data mining but feel powerless to stop it. The NYT reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/iadW00BrP6L00A000Dq2A04>  a majority (55%) of survey respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that it’s all right for retailers to use information about shoppers to improve the services they provide consumers. And 84% of respondents claim they’d like more control over the data marketers collect about them, but 65% said they have little power to amend current practices. Mike Zaneis, the chief counsel for the IAB, argues the inverse. “People are always willing to trade privacy and information when they see the direct value of sharing that information,” he said. 

Snap Crackle Metrics 

Sony’s VOD platform, Crackle, is partnering with analytics firm Moat and Comcast’s video-management company, FreeWheel, to offer advertisers real-time viewability metrics. René Santaella, SVP of global ad strategy and operations at Sony, tells  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0rbA0000q0D720LAWd> Variety the move aims to boost digital video viewability. “With more and more linear TV networks announcing streaming plans and entering the digital space, it’s important to ensure the premium experience is properly valued,” he said. The move responds to broadcasters clamoring for a higher digital viewability standard, many of whom (*cough* GroupM) would like to see the MRC’s standard of 50% in-view for two seconds amended. 

Castle On A Swamp 

As Facebook and Google push more mobile video, eMarketer predicts spend in the format will go up 70% this year to a total of $2.62 billion. But that still pales in comparison to what brands are spending on desktop digital video or mobile advertising overall. Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Ld82cADP0r00A0>  that YouTube, which is the preeminent player in online video, already gets more views on mobile than desktop, but it still can’t get advertisers to invest in mobile as a platform despite the supply. Either companies are getting mobile video spend at bargain bin prices or everyone who relies on mobile traffic could face structural problems.

Taking The High Road 

In emails to AdExchanger, executives at Shine and Adblock Plus, two of the most prominent ad-blocking companies, emphasized that despite reports to the contrary, they want to improve the digital advertising ecosystem, not ruin it. Interestingly, Google CEO Larry Page seems to agree, saying about ad blockers at a shareholders meeting, “Part of it is the industry needs to do better at producing ads that are less annoying, and that are quicker to load, and all those things.” Maybe Google just minds paying the Adblock Plus whitelisting fee less than everyone else.

*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pr500q2707> Thursday, June 4, News Round-Up (see below)
*	Programmatic Essentials L.A., June 11 <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP08602q0L0AB0Dr00A74>  - Sponsored by The Trade Desk and PubMatic.
*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q07WD0L7000B4000r9> Data-Driven Thinking column...Why Programmatic Budgets Will See Massive Growth by Eric Picard, MediaMath "Even when media-buying teams were specialized by media type, such as TV buyers and magazine buyers, the fragmentation problem still faced an unmanageable outcome. But digital media has blurred the lines between channels..."
*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00aWqA000rP7A08040D2L> Facebook And GroupM Tussle On Third-Party Viewability Verification "Whenever we have these third-party discussions with [Facebook and Google] they say, ‘Our technology is so good we can probably measure what’s appeared and what’s viewable better than you can’ – but that’s not the point,” John Montgomery, COO of GroupM Interaction, North America, said. “It’s not good governance to measure yourself..."
*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/GrB0A720D94bW0AL0000P0q> IRCE: Target Rewrites Its Omnichannel Strategy, But It’s Still Catching Up "Target initially worried its subscription business would cannibalize in-store sales, but it discovered just the opposite. While customers ordered high-frequency items (paper towels, dish soap) via subscription, they increasingly are buying bigger-ticket items like patio furniture online, which will soon surpass the volume purchased in-store..."
*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/uc0000DB4L0A0a027PqWAr0> How Heineken Sees Marketers Flexing The Power Of The Purse "By making it common practice for brands and agencies to hash out their own terms on fraud standards, Heineken senior media director Ron Amram sees market forces partially neutralizing the problem, without heavy-handed responses from industry groups at large..."
*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/gd0D40L0q20rBA0AW000b7P> FTC: Publishers Will Be Held Responsible For Misleading Native Ads "Engle indicated that the FTC will focus less on the content of native advertising, and more on how such advertising is displayed and labeled on the site. 'I would urge advertisers to think about how to communicate [disclosure] to consumers while wanting the ad to be in the flow of what consumers are seeing,' Mary Engle, the FTC's associate director of advertising practices, said..."
*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPre07q0AD00B4c020W0> Tribune Publishing Focuses On Being A Data-First Sales Organization "As a publication with both print and digital arms, Tribune Publishing uses its DMP to identify readers based on subscriber and registration data. After removing PII, it matches those users to an advertiser’s CRM or point-of-sale (POS) system for efficient targeting..."
*	 <http://go.adexchanger.com/l7Bqd000LrDP0A2A4000f0W> Yahoo Says Welcome To Third-Party Fraud And Viewability Tags "'There is no such thing as perfect measurement and it doesn’t make sense for publishers or platforms to say that they are the single source of truth, because that doesn’t allow advertisers to consistently measure across all of the platforms they work with,' Dennis Buchheim, VP of product management at Yahoo, said..."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

DSP Wave 

Forrester ranks DataXu, AppNexus, AOL, Turn and The Trade Desk among the industry’s top demand-side platforms in its latest Wave report. Google is relegated to a second tier of “competitive” options (along with MediaMath and Audience Science), penalized for lagging on its DMP and CRM data onboarding offerings – as well as for opting out of Forrester’s questions. Nine DSPs are reviewed in all. Mediapost has a story. <http://go.adexchanger.com/FrDBL00ge0W0P27q000AA04>  

In-Housing 

Two years after ditching its digital agency and shifting all ad buying to programmatic channels, Zipcar CMO Brian Harrington says the decision was spurred by a lack of transparency. “A big piece of my frustration in working with a traditional agency is that it felt like a black box,” Harrington told the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBf000A7r0A200WL4qPh00> . Harrington also took issue with the trading desk model, and cited concerns about fraud and waste. Agencies can’t catch a break. Elsewhere in the Journal, Russel Wohlwerth, a principal at External View Consulting Group, shares theories to explain why large advertisers are shuttering their media agency relationships at an unprecedented rate. Read that <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0ig02q0L0AB0Dr00A74> . 

QR Codes 2.0 

UK-based Powa Technologies says it has 1,200 brands across North America, Western Europe and South Africa who are on board to deploy the company’s PowaTags, “QR-code-like images embedded on magazine, outdoor or in-store ads” that attempt to turn offline and print advertising into potential ecommerce. According to Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PhD7A40LrB00jA> , Powa is following boldly in the footsteps of other companies that have aimed to bridge offline/online using QR codes…most of which have fallen flat. But with $160 million in funding at a $2.7 billion valuation, Powa is well placed. 

Cook’s Privacy Proclamation 

Apple CEO Tim Cook made waves when, during an acceptance speech for EPIC’s Champions of Freedom corporate leadership award, he lambasted the way big tech firms use consumer data. “I’m speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information,” he said. “They’re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think that’s wrong. And it’s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.” More via TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ti0W70P0r000DBk20L4qAA0> . 

Ready Set Mobile 

In an interview with Digitas LBi’s CIO, Adam Shlachter, The Drift’s Doug Weaver asks if the digital ad business is ready for a mobile-first world. According to Shlachter, publishers and brands are building apps and optimizing the mobile web, and Google is tweaking its search algorithm to reward those efforts. “But there are still as many, if not more, poor mobile user experiences that exist for consumers, including some of the mobile advertising that often accompanies it,” Shlachter said. “We have to make better use of the signals we have – of intent, of location, of behavior – and use that to create better experiences that people can rely on, and brands can see a bigger benefit from.” Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000072lr0L0B0jA4PDAq> the interview.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Xaxis Hatches An Agency 

WPP-owned Xaxis debuted a performance marketing agency dubbed Light Reaction on Tuesday. The move is a departure from Xaxis’ core programmatic business, but chief Brian Lesser tells Ad Age the company wants to increase its performance marketing efforts, which now account for 10% of Xaxis’ $700 million business. "We see this part of the business growing as rapidly if not more than the business we already built within Xaxis," Lesser said. "There's a growing market need for companies that aren't only expert in data, technology and programmatic but also in delivering outcomes on a model that guarantees those outcomes."

Instagram Embraces Performance 

Instagram is bringing some direct-response mechanisms to its ad formats, allowing brands to sell products, promote app downloads or drive site registrations among other things. There’s new targeting options too. “Advertisers ... want to target their messages in more effective ways and reach people not just because of their age, location and gender, but because of the people, places and things they love,” says a blog post. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/TO0W20P0r000DBV20L4qAA0>  And, WSJ has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0W2rWPP0A00> . 

Sprinklr’s Spree 

Sprinklr snapped up text analytics firm NewBrand, its seventh acquisition in 18 months. Sprinklr, whose latest $46 million funding values it at $1 billion, aims to compete with the likes of Salesforce and Percolate to help companies marry social marketing and customer support. “It’s becoming a three or four horse race with a clear set of companies that big brands can bank on moving forward,” Sprinklr founder Ragy Thomas told Forbes.

Ghosting In The Cloud 

Ghostery launched its TrackerMap Live application in the Oracle Marketing AppCloud. The integration gives marketers and publishers tools to protect website integrity from nonsecure tags, in addition to competitive intelligence. Marketers using Ghostery’s TrackerMap can also do third-party auditing. Ghostery’s VP of product, Larry Furr, says, “The complexity and rapid growth of cloud-based digital marketing tools used by companies must be managed to ensure security and a positive online customer experience.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0rS0B4L0Z2AAP00q0D200> . 

Digital Substitution 

A report from FTI Consulting claims digital ad spending will surpass TV spots this year. The report predicts digital ad spend will jump 11% to hit $41.8 billion in 2015, whereas broadcast ad revenue will increase to $38.9 billion. “Our model suggests that digital substitution is the primary driver contributing to changes in the television ad ecosystem today,” said Philip Schuman, senior managing director of FTI’s media and entertainment team. Bloomberg has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0UL00003P02BAqDr0040A> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

A Day In The Life 

Ad Age takes readers through a routine day for Andre Banilevi, a 23-year-old programmatic ad buyer for MDC’s programmatic arm, Varick Media. One of 10 traders for Varick, Banilevi represents a growing group of math-savvy buyers behind the levers of automated trading. These specialists are wanted men and women, according to Ad Age, and Banilevi and his co-workers disclosed they’ve heard from in-house marketers including Netflix as brands look to poach talent with programmatic expertise. Varick chief Paul Rostkowski knows the value of his programmatic staff. "I'm subject to lose all these people at some point in time," he said.

Media Review Landslide 

Reporting on the 20 large advertisers who’ve put their media agencies up for review in the past six months, Business Insider reporter Lara O’Reilly pens <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0U0P4qA02000WLg000AqDB>  a handful of theories to explain the trend. Marketers could be reacting to a lack of transparency about how budgets are being managed, or, they might be spending more on new mediums like digital video. It could also be a domino effect, where several advertisers sparked a landslide for the industry at large. At stake is $25 billion in ad spend, but "[a]gencies who have embraced yesterday’s science fiction and made it into today’s normalcy have nothing to fear,” notes Richard Robinson, managing partner of Oystercatchers, an intermediary firm that connects brands and agencies. 

Following The Money 

As publishers and media companies like Facebook and Google continue to build their internal creative (providing content for native campaigns, designing ads and interfaces, shooting videos), traditional ad agencies are struggling to compete for talent. The WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0U0P4qA02000WLh010AqDB>  quotes J. Walter Thompson board member Bob Jeffrey, who claims there is “pop-culture cachet that some of these new players can offer.” The director of talent acquisition at Leo Burnett says The Onion poached its creative talent when the satire pub branched into branded content. There are other market forces at play besides “pop cachet,” however. Agency execs claim their paltry starting salaries aren’t a factor, while the tech industry pays a premium for young talent. 

Button Up 

Foursquare is tapping into its geolocation and consumer intent through a partnership with Uber. TechCrunch reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0qqW0D002AiB0U4PA>  that Foursquare is adding an in-app touchpoint via Button, a deep-linking firm, that enables users to pick out the bar/restaurant/venue they have in mind and automatically order an Uber from their location to the destination. As companies open up their platforms for integration, as Uber did recently with its API, startups like Button are hoping to build a web of frictionless commerce between apps.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Power Of The Purse

Kellogg is dialing down its ad spend on Google properties, including YouTube, due to Google’s restrictions on third-party measurement. GroupM CIO Rino Scanzoni tells Ad Age, “Third-party verification is a critical component to responsively measure ad viewability. The vast majority of publishers agree to it and the few that don't will be adversely impacted with significantly reduced spend.” Google claims to have nearly solved for viewability on its O&O properties with a 91% viewability rate on YouTube. But there’s no verification like third-party verification. More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0VL0000NP02BAqDq0i40A> 

Busy Snapchat  

CNBC reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00W0jL0NW00AD2q0qA04>  Snapchat is out raising a $650 million equity round, valuing the ephemeral messaging startup at $16 billion – or about 5x Vice Media. The ephemeral messaging startup is also gunning for an IPO. CEO Evan Spiegel didn’t split hairs onstage at Re/code’s Code Conference in LA. "We need to IPO,” he said. “We have a plan to do that.” Spiegel has been vocal about making the platform into a more profitable business, which it plans to do by selling more ads. More via Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PXB00000AN4Dq02qWk0> .

CPGs Have Efficiency Mindset

eMarketer predicts nearly two-thirds of display investment from CPG marketers will be spent programmatically this year, and cost efficiencies are part of the reason. Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal are among those aiming to do more with less by leveraging data. “For CPG brands, which have been able to amass client data from third-party sources such as retailers and loyalty programs, the challenge is to corral that data and make it useful,” reports eMarketer <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0qqW0D00YAlB0N4PA> . P&G spent 14.4% less on advertising in 2014 than in 2013, according to Kantar Media, while L’Oréal spent 8.3% less during that timeframe.

One of the big justifications for Facebook’s Instant Articles product is the user experience benefits of faster-loading news content. Catchpoint Systems, a web performance monitoring firm, tells the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LNm2ZADP0q00A0> , “Early data suggest Facebook might be right.” The home pages of 50 major news outlets loaded, according to Catchpoint Systems, at an average of 3.66 seconds. Facebook Instant Articles loaded “nearly instantly,” at zero to 300 milliseconds. Can publishers compete on speed?

Programmatic, Eh?

BrightRoll partnered with IAB Canada to survey 130 agency execs about their programmatic video strategies. About 20% of Canadian agencies plan to spend more than 60% of their digital video budgets programmatically this year – that’s up about 10%. A third of agencies will spend a more modest 40-59% of their digital video budgets programmatically. MediaPost has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW00L0000NP02BAqDq0n40A> .
