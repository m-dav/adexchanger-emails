 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

No Payne 

Twitter’s game of musical chairs continues with the partial exit of MoPub CEO Jim Payne, AdAge’s Mark Bergen reports. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBI000Agf0A200WL4qPN00> . Payne will serve as an ad tech advisor to CFO Anthony Noto, but will no longer run Twitter’s programmatic exchange. That job falls to Janae McDonough. Related: In a Tuesday DM slip-up, Noto signalled his intent to acquire a mystery company. Re/code speculates Drawbridge could be on its short list. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00f0Og0WJDP0L0A00>  

Follow The Install 

Yahoo aims to capture app install budgets with a new Tumblr ad format, called Tumblr Sponsored Apps. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBK000Agf0A200WL4qPP00> , Tumblr said the format will help advertisers target the “25% of active gamers who use Tumblr, according to comScore. But expect to see apps from publishers, makers of creative tools, and entertainment platforms too.” Yahoo already offers app install ad products, but this is the only format exclusive to Tumblr. Beta customers are GREE, Big Fish and Betaworks. 

Automating Influence 

Berlin-based startup Brandnew IO surfaced with a tool on Tuesday that puts brands and advertisers in control of its International Influencer Network. The network is made up of “influential” users on social media, namely Instagram and Twitter. For client Panasonic, “We used the creative diversity of our influencers to reflect that of the Panasonic camera models, each matched to the Instagrammer’s photography style,” Brandnew IO CEO Francis Trapp told AdExchanger. Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0QL02q0L0AB0Df00Ag4> , and AdExchanger’s June interview with Trapp <http://go.adexchanger.com/iMgW00BfPRL00A000Dq2A04> . 

Mic Check 

Publisher Mic wants be the ad buy of choice for brands targeting millennials, Digiday reports. Since August, its strategy has been to ditch banner ads and lean exclusively on “native.” Brands like Microsoft, Cole Haan and Cadillac have jumped aboard. A recent campaign for GE offered interactive quizzes and articles that drew 320,000 to the landing page since last week. But going “all custom” takes its toll: “It took Mic’s branded content team five weeks to think up and create the Map Your Mind interactive.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/uS0000DB4L0A0N02gPqWAf0> . 

Ramping Up Facebook Video 

With holiday ads in mind, Facebook has sold “premium” video ads to Macy’s and a handful of other companies, Reuters reports. Though a departure for the retailer, Macy’s VP for Digital Media Jennifer Kasper said the online push will complement traditional TV spots. "We do believe we are going to reach an incremental audience who are no longer tuning in to traditional TV," she said. "For people who have seen it on TV, it keeps us top of mind." All aboard the Facebook video train. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/uT0000DB4L0A0O02gPqWAf0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Data Sharing Is Data Caring 

A Forrester report released Monday examines how brands share data with each other, and what benefits they derive from doing so. The key advantage of so-called “second-party data,” in brief, is that it’s not as scarce as first-party data but it provides unique insights not always available in third-party data sets. “Dell and Intel ... share data so Dell can benefit from Intel’s demand generation marketing activities and close the sales loop.” As always, there are issues with sharing, including finding compatible partners and the fact that the practice might freak out consumers and regulators. Get it <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0dcfWP40A00> . [Paid download] 

Outbrain APIs 

Outbrain released APIs that let partners and clients manage, measure and execute bids on content campaigns. “Now that programmatic has entered the content marketer’s world, I believe that it will drive adoption by a new wave of digital marketers who are primed to take advantage of it,” said Shafqat Islam, CEO of Newscred, an Outbrain partner since July. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW05L0000cP02BAqDf0e40A> . The API release comes on the heels of Outbrain’s $100 million, multiyear deal to provide content ads on Time Inc. properties. Another day, another ecosystem. 

More Installs 

App downloads hit an all-time high in October, growing 42% sequentially and 39% year over year, according to Fiksu’s index. The cost to acquire a loyal user fell slightly last month, as Apple fans reinstalled all their favorite apps after upgrading. But the long-term trend is toward higher prices to acquire mobile users, and that’s likely to continue. That may be OK as long as apps remain in hot demand. “While recent indexes have shown a steady stream of escalating costs, the October index numbers validate another important trend: the increasing importance of apps to consumers," explained Fiksu CEO Micah Adler. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00fWqA000fPcA06040D2L> . 

Snapchat Deal Codes 

Amazon (the commerce giant, not the ad platform) is doing more on Snapchat and Instagram in time for the holidays. Last week, the company unveiled plans to embed deal codes in its branded Snapchats, and has already turned on shopping in its Instagram feed. “Snapchat is slowly understanding how they’d like to monetize their app but it also seems like they want to introduce ads in a nonintrusive way,” said Esha Shah, manager of mobile strategy and innovation at Fetch. Mobile Commerce Daily has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB7000Acf0A200WL4qPg00> . 

Shopping For Data 

After being acquired by Japan-based Rakuten in August, shopping and package tracking app Slice has made its own purchase. On Monday, the company bought Unroll.Me, an email organization app that helps users manage online subscriptions. Rakuten also snapped up Ebates this year for a cool $1 billion. Rakuten is on an ecommerce acquisition roll, and the customer insights are piling up. Read on via TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00hWqA000fPcA08040D2L> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Native ‘Working’ 

Marketers will spend $4.3 billion on native advertising in 2015, up 34% from 2014, according to eMarketer. "I would expect our spending in this area to increase considerably over the next 18 months, specifically in the area of video," HP’s director of strategy, Ed McLoughlin, told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/qfAW0A0DLC004702B0PQ00q> . “We just dipped our toe into the water this year, but I would say we'll see a five- to 10-times increase over what we spent this year," added Matt Eaves, VP-engagement at Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Eaves thinks native advertising is "definitely becoming a line item in the budget that we'll have dedicated dollars to put against because I believe it's working." By 2018, eMarketer predicts native ad spend will reach $8.8 billion. 

Breaking Up Google 

Google can’t catch a break in Europe. Its latest headache is a resolution, advanced by German regulators, proposing a breakup of the company as part of a 4-year-old EU antitrust investigation into Google’s search and ads business. While nonbinding, the resolution “would probably increase pressure on Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, to bring formal charges against Google,” says The New York Times. Read on. <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0fD0B4L0R2AAP00q0D700>  

Northern Exposure 

Findings from Acuity Ads and Marketing Magazine reveal that fewer than 10% of Canadian marketers are comfortable buying programmatically. Of the 522 marketers surveyed, 34% had never heard the term programmatic and nearly 50% of those that had rated their understanding of programmatic “very poor.” “When brands start to see and feel the efficiencies programmatic buying can deliver, it will be a mad rush, and they’ll be demanding it of their agencies and looking at bringing it in-house,” Maggie Fox, global SVP of marketing for SAP, told Marketing. “It’s just a matter of time.” That said, Canadian marketers already embracing programmatic estimate their brands will commit 15.9% of ad budgets to automation, and predict that figure will nearly double by 2017.

Bubbling Up Content 

OneSpot wants to help marketers find quality content for ads on top publishers' sites and social networks.  “Instead of basing [content efforts] simply on the brand goals, they can base it in part on actual data that we have, in terms of how content is successfully distributed and sequenced," said OneSpot CMO Adam Weinroth. “These pieces have been siloed. We are bringing them together for big brands." Time Inc., Meredith, Contently and NewsCred have signed on. Adweek has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0fF0B4L0T2AAP00q0D700> . 

Sales Management Gap 

In a sales leadership survey floated by UpStream and Seller Cloud, 58% said they were being managed “modestly but inconsistently,” “poorly” or “not at all.” Commenters on Seller Crowd’s message board suggests managers spend more time engaging with sellers on strategy and focus less on number-crunching. “As we head into the new year, maybe we all commit to filling ‘the digital sales management gap,’” writes Doug Weaver in The Drift.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Yahoo Search On Fire(fox) 

Late on Wednesday, Firefox struck a deal to make Yahoo its exclusive and default search engine, after a 10-year-long relationship with Google. In a statement <http://go.adexchanger.com/A20m04WB200AfPq00L0F0DA> , Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer called the deal “the most significant partnership for Yahoo in five years,” adding that it “helps to expand our reach in search and gives us an opportunity to work even more closely with Mozilla to find ways to innovate in search, communications, and digital content.” A notable condition of the deal was that Yahoo agreed to Mozilla’s “do not track” feature, that lets users opt out of cookie tracking. But what’s Yahoo scheming to do will all that search data? The NYT has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/FfDBL00Gn0W0P22q000AA04> . 

Ad Serving By Bezos 

The Washington Post built its own ad server for its Amazon Tablet app, Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqoB0f2LW004D0P0AAH0200> , and Lincoln and Sprint are the first sponsors to test it. “Advertising was at the development table at the very beginning," said Jeff Burkett, the Post's senior director of sales operations and product strategy. "It was a first-class citizen." The Jeff Bezos-owned paper’s chief technology officer, Shailesh Prakash, said the publisher shopped around for several third-party ad servers before deciding to build its own, a project that took months. According to Prakash, the Post plans to eventually incorporate content-based native ads in the Post app for Amazon Tablet. 

Google’s Confusing Ad Blocker Ploy 

In a surprising push into crowdfunding, Google piloted an experimental offering that helps publishers make money by blocking advertisements. Google dubbed the service Contributor, and for now it’s invite-only, but early partners include The Onion, Mashable, Imgur, and Urban Dictionary. Web users who sign up choose a monthly contribution fee of between $1 and $3. “When you visit a participating website, part of your contribution goes to the creators of that site,” Google explained in a blogpost <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABL2WI0APfp020qD40> . “As a reminder of your support, you’ll see a thank you message - often accompanied by a pixel pattern - where you might normally see an ad.” 

Publicis’ Promise 

During a conference in Barcelona run by Morgan Stanley, Publicis Groupe CEO Maurice Lévy expressed severe dissatisfaction with the holding company’s recent performance. “We are not delivering the kind of growth we are used to and not what we should do,” said a displeased Lévy. To turn the tide, he said the company will pump the brakes on any major acquisitions in the near future and concentrate on driving sales. “The focus is to fix the organic growth of Publicis, integrate Sapient, and to make sure it is generally the kind of growth that the market is expecting from us,” Levy added.

‘Real World’ Location 

Location analytics firm Placed released a ranking of the “most popular businesses in the US based on visitation.” The list, “Placed 100 <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PK4020DrAfq2> ,” measures foot traffic, real-world store visits, and offline behavior based on data pulled from a location panel of about half a million smartphone users who have opted to be tracked. The report ranked Walmart and McDonald’s as the two most visited businesses in America. Others in the top 10 include Walgreens, Target and CVS. Although Placed previously issued similar rankings (AdExchanger coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPfL02q0AD00B4s020W0> ), they weren't available for public consumption.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Yahoo’s Appetite 

Marissa Mayer is still shopping for ad tech in the wake of Yahoo’s BrightRoll and Flurry deals, and she’s cast an acquisitive eye on a few demand-side players, including MediaMath and Turn, writes Re/code's Kara Swisher <http://go.adexchanger.com/lYBqx000LeDP0A2A4000V0W> . Her piece also mentions RadiumOne, whose founder Gurbaksh Chahal sold Blue Lithium to Yahoo for $300 million in 2007. (Chahal was removed as RadiumOne's CEO earlier this year <http://go.adexchanger.com/Be00yW2A000040YB0DWLPqA> .) Separately, Swisher cites the possibility of a much larger deal to buy Research In Motion. Why? Aside from giving Yahoo a mobile device to play with, a RIM deal could alleviate the company’s tax burden resulting from its Alibaba gains <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPeX4B00W000qAY0020AzD> . 

Measuring The Video Stream 

Nielsen will start to measure viewing stats for a number of streaming services, The Wall Street Journal reports. First up is Netflix, but Amazon’s Prime Instant Video won’t be far behind. Buried in the WSJ story is a finding by Nielsen that time spent on streaming services is sapping viewers from traditional TV. “There is a certain indication that as you acquire [subscription online video], your television use, in terms of traditional television use, is going down,” said Dounia Turrill, Nielsen’s SVP of client insights. Let the attrition commence. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0e0YWD0L4PA0A2q0Y0BA00> . 

Sunny Skies for CRM 

Salesforce.com pulled in $132 million in revenue for Marketing Cloud in the third quarter, a 29% increase year-over-year. Retailer Office Depot was a “significant Marketing Cloud win” this quarter. Separately, the company baked Social Studio, an amalgamation of various social marketing acquisitions like Buddy Media and Radian6, into the broader Marketing Cloud console. “We had done a bunch of acquisitions over the last two years and [this integration] is the first where we’ve really pulled cloud, mobile, and social into one unified marketing platform,” Mike Lazerow, chief strategy officer for Salesforce.com Marketing Cloud, told AdExchanger.

All Together Now 

Mediaocean will begin displaying online video ad opportunities alongside the familiar TV vehicles in its Spectra media-buying interface. Mediaocean CEO Bill Wise tells WSJ’s Mike Shields, “This is about truly converging the two sectors into one system … In our system, now a client can say, ‘I have a hundred million in my budget, how do I think about spending it?’” The convergence was made possible by a partnership with Videology.

Tremor Talking TV 

Tremor Video CEO Bill Day feted the programmatic future of television in an interview with  <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq02eA00FZD0AP00040> MediaWeek. “Programmatic buying will bring the success of digital ad targeting into TV advertising, which will revolutionise TV's ability to reach the right people and move away from simply maximising reach in hope of reaching the desired audience,” said Day. He added that even within programmatic TV buying, “there will always be a need for marketers to establish and maintain relationships as well as understand and effectively apply data.” His prediction for 2015? Video everywhere.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Time Inc. Recommends 

Time Inc. has picked Outbrain to be the exclusive content discovery platform for its owned and operated sites. The multiyear deal is expected to earn the publisher an estimated $100 million. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00Vg0ALAWPPeB02q000> . Time Inc. will also adopt Outbrain’s premium publisher network to drive audiences to its digital properties. Content recommendation can get a bad rap for spreading click-bait around the web, but Outbrain CRO Tom Foran says the company has purged some offenders from its customer base. "Low quality is in the eye of the beholder,” Foran told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0hVeWPQ0A00> . 

Merkle Invests In Customer Loyalty 

CRM firm Merkle snapped up San Francisco-based 500friends on Tuesday for an undisclosed sum. 500friends works with retailers such as 1-800 Flowers and Dermalogica to personalize loyalty experiences. “We see a tremendous opportunity in the customer loyalty segment of the market as more companies are investing in loyalty as a key customer growth strategy,” said David Williams, Merkle’s CEO. The move mirrors Catalina’s acquisition of digital coupon provider Cellfire <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPei4B00W000qAV0020ARD>  last month to expand its mobile and digital presence for CPG marketers. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/TS0WV0P0e000DBj20L4qAA0> . 

Flurry Activity 

Yahoo is making a push around in-app mobile video buys, and is integrating Flurry, acquired four months ago, with its ad platform to help get there. How might this mesh with Yahoo’s BrightRoll buy last week? BrightRoll “reaches four out of five consumers via videos in the US," Scott Burke, Yahoo SVP of advertising, told Adweek’s Christopher Heine. "So they are going to bring in that scale of programmatic. What Flurry brings is the huge range of mobile applications. We haven't made any product announcements there, but it is an obvious connection to make. Once we close that deal, we can talk more specifically about it.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0eAAT0DkV00> . 

Apps Killed The Internet Star 

Speaking of Flurry, the app platform reported 86% of time is spent on mobile devices is in apps, compared to just 14% on the web. With the convenience of apps, writes The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mims, comes the imminent demise of the web, the danger being that app gatekeepers like Facebook, Apple and Microsoft are setting the rules. “It isn’t that today’s kings of the app world want to quash innovation, per se. It is that in the transition to a world in which services are delivered through apps, rather than the Web, we are graduating to a system that makes innovation, serendipity and experimentation that much harder for those who build things that rely on the Internet,” writes Mims. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0UL0000VP02BAqDe0l40A> . 

Big Box Navigation 

Target is turning on in-store navigation features in its app, thanks to startup Point Inside’s StoreMode technology. Consumers browsing the retailer’s aisles can create shopping lists, locate products and check inventory availability. “People actually buy more when they’re interacting physically with the product [and] from the overall brand experience, it’s a way to have a focused interaction with your customer base,” Point Inside VP of Business Operations Mike McMurray told Street Fight <http://go.adexchanger.com/qeAW0A0DLV004V02B0Pm00q> . The tech provider's CEO, Josh Marti, added, “Mobile’s influence on in-store retail is rapidly expanding and we believe that the best retailers will benefit greatly by satisfying customer demand for mobile-assisted in-store shopping.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Poaching YouTube’s Users 

Ex-Hulu CEO Jason Kilar has been working on a platform to challenge YouTube’s online video dominance. The video streaming service, dubbed Vessel, is staffed by a fleet of ex-Hulu, Netflix and Amazon leaders, and Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0P0P4qA02000WLG090AeDB>  that it could debut as early as this month. Vessel will offer both free and subscription-based access, with both versions slated to serve ads and work across apps, desktop and mobile sites. Naturally, there are possible ties to connected-TV services like Apple TV, Roku and Xbox. Purportedly, Vessel’s secret sauce will be signing YouTube creators to yearlong contracts that require creators to upload new content to Vessel and wait 72 hours before posting elsewhere. 

Private Auction Potential 

Google wants its private exchanges to ease brand marketers into programmatic by marrying automation with creative, Adweek’s Garrett Sloane writes. “There is a sense that advertising technology and creative are at odds, but I don’t see it that way,” said Neal Mohan, VP of display and video ads. “Technology is something that should fade away and empower creative agencies to do what they do best: find ways to connect brands with consumers.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40H0A2P0BaLD0WeP00q0A0> . 

Social Value 

Are brands wasting their efforts on Facebook and Twitter? Forrester analyst Nate Elliott writes in a blog post that top brand marketers only reach about 2% of their fans and followers via Facebook and Twitter posts, and interactions clock in at an abysmal 0.1%. “It’s clear that Facebook and Twitter don’t offer the relationships that marketing leaders crave,” Elliott writes. “Yet most brands still use these sites as the centerpiece of their social efforts — thereby wasting significant financial, technological, and human resources on social networks that don’t deliver value.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00PI0ALAWPbeB02q000>  On Friday <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0PA0DB0WJ2Lq00eA00c4P0>  Facebook said it would further dial down nonpaid page posts in the news feed. Elliott, a frequent critic of Facebook’s algorithms, suggests marketers rethink their social strategies, and says Facebook will soon become a “repository for display ads.” The WSJ has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqdP04A0LB0WAP02e0000KD> . 

Raising Eyebrows 

Eyeview has raised $15 million to drive adoption of its personalized video platform. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0eAAe0DLP00> . In a recent AdExchanger interview, CEO Oren Harnevo said, “We take the original TV ad and change stuff: We’ll change the price, and [the information will] come off a feed. The technology takes different pieces and renders the media, so we’re left with hundreds of thousands of videos in the cloud.” Read that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0P0P4qA02000WLM0f0AeDB>  Also, Eyeview hired former Conversant exec Brian Pozesky as CMO and West Naze, former EVP of sales and tech at News Corp., to spearhead CPG sales. 

Shazam OOH 

Shazam and Adspace Networks teamed up to bring interactive ads to more than 200 malls nationwide. Through the partnership, Shazam’s “ultrasonic watermark” tech will recognize smartphone users up to 40 feet away, and serve shoppers special content and offers. “Through our partnership with Shazam, we are able to offer our advertisers a seamless way to retarget their ads and extend their content to consumers’ smartphones,” said Adspace Networks CEO Dominick Porco. The challenge is convincing users to reimagine Shazam’s functionality. The service has long been used for music discovery. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqgP04A0LB0WAP02e0000ND> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

FB: Money Talks, ‘Likes’ Walk 

On Friday, Facebook revealed plans to remaster news feed content with controls that edge out promoted posts from brands. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0jeA00JMD0AP00040> , Facebook explained that it’s not ads that irk users. According to its research, it’s an oversaturation of posts from pages users have “liked.” So, beginning in January, unpaid posts will further dwindle from the news feed. “It’s a clear message to brands: If you want to sound like an advertiser, buy an ad,” said Rebecca Lieb, a digital advertising and media analyst for the Altimeter Group. Though Facebook insists this will not decrease the number of ads users experience, Mindshare NA Chief Strategy Officer Jordan Bitterman points out, “Facebook is basically saying that their algorithm will be the arbiter of what’s promotion and what’s not promotion.” The New York Times has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Be00KW2A000040MB0DkLPqA> . 

A Publisher’s Burden 

Publications are struggling to marry technology and media, and failure to do so could be fatal. Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0eLA0q0l0BAL0PDM2>  that Time Inc.’s head of print and digital sales, Moritz Loew, is heading for the exit. And as if on cue, Say Media says XoJane and its owned sites (ReadWrite, Fashionista and Remodelista) are up for sale. “The conclusion we’ve come to, and one lots of media companies wrestle with is, do you build brands or do you build platforms?” said Say Media CEO Matt Sanchez. “Those two are just completely different world views. It’s hard to create clarity for an organization.” Publishers: Embrace innovation or get out of the kitchen. Digiday has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4M0M0P00qD002LBW0mAe> . 

LiveRailing 

Jack Marshall offers up a Q&A with Facebook business and marketing chief David Fischer in The Wall Street Journal.  Among other topics, Fischer addresses his company’s LiveRail acquisition <http://go.adexchanger.com/FeDBL00nN0W0P2Mq000AA04>  from July: “LiveRail is very early, the acquisition closed in summer. ... What we see as an opportunity is to take something that’s working successfully and to extend it as we bring in people-based marketing. That’s something we’ll do with LiveRail next year.”  Read it (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0e00MqOo> . 

Agnostic Atlas 

During ExchangeWire’s ATS Paris event last week, Facebook Atlas exec Francois-Xavier Pierrel said Atlas is agnostic. “What we [at Atlas] don’t do is send data back to Facebook, in the same way we don’t tell marketers who people are,” said Pierrel, Atlas’ Southern Europe regional manager. “Any time we gather information from Facebook, we are serving advertisers. To us, Facebook is just another company… [that] has an entire ecosystem with things like LiveRail, etc., so it’s not just Atlas. And Facebook as a publisher is just one point in the whole ecosystem. Being agnostic is our general stance to ensure that there’s a distinction between church and state.” Read the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/TP0WM0P0e000DBp20L4qAA0> . 

Owning The Social Data 

A new offering from data company Umbel aims to help brand marketers take action on the data they collect from social networks like Facebook and Instagram. The platform offers tools to unify, visualize and convert data, with analysis tech that sorts through an enormous number of audience profiles. “With Umbel for brands, [brand marketers] no longer have to hand their valuable customer data over to the middlemen of digital advertising,” said Umbel CEO H.O. Maycotte. Even when brand marketers change vendors, added Maycotte, “They own the data. They can take action on it — on their own terms and without relying on others.” Read on at AllFacebook <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PeQ00q2q0M> .

Addressable TV’s Horizons 

Addressable TV is growing, but likely won’t threaten traditional TV anytime soon. At the Advanced Advertising Television conference in NYC last week, Jamie Power, a senior partner for GroupM’s Modi Media, estimated that addressable TV will reach 60 million households in 2015. “We’re getting extremely granular,” Power said, but cautioned that “addressable isn’t right for every advertiser. Generally advertisers that have a larger segment, it’s more efficient to spend the money in national cable.” Read on via Multichannel <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40s0A2M0BSLD0WeP00q0A0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Blackout Benefits 

Wednesday’s 90-minute global outage of DoubleClick for Advertisers was a glaring reminder of Google’s ad server dominance, and sent publishers scrambling to tally their make-goods. But some publishers benefited from Google’s fumble, Ad Age reports. Data from Casale Media, an ad exchange, suggests sites not reliant on DoubleClick made 26% more during the blackout, as dollars flowed through other programmatic exchanges to their pages. “Some publishers literally doubled,” said Andrew Casale, the exchange’s VP for strategy. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pl40H0DGAeq2> . 

eBay’s Programmatic Roadmap 

eBay is rolling out native ads that will eventually be available programmatically, The Drum reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/FeDBL00mH0W0P2Hq000AA04> . “In order to get native programmatic working at scale, we as an industry must better define some of the variables,” said eBay’s head of advertising, Phuong Nguyen. “There is no reason whatsoever that any publisher should be constraining what they put into their programmatic set-up, and if they are doing that they’re not truly embracing what programmatic is all about.” eBay’s head of programmatic, Jean-Baptiste Goux, added that native mobile formats will be available programmatically in 2015. 

The State Of Video 

Comcast-owned FreeWheel released its quarterly video monetization report on Thursday and found that, since last year, authenticated ad views have grown 368%. The findings detail rising concerns about quality of inventory, inconsistent fill rates, viewability and fraud. “Because of the collective concerns of both marketers and publishers, we are starting to see greater movement toward programmatic reserved deals (guaranteed deals between the publisher and a brand or agency executing directly between the DSP and sell-side ad management platform), and a departure from the use of open exchanges,” reads the report. “Publishers, however, still wish to maintain strict control of their inventory and ensure compliance is maintained.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PIBnD000qA2H04L0e> . 

Cadreon And Beyond 

Interpublic Group has paired up with Millennial Media to strengthen its programmatic foothold in mobile. The deal encompassees IPG’s Cadreon trading desk as well as its operating agencies.  “IPG agencies and their clients will be eligible for greater efficiencies, custom research, access to Millennial Media’s robust and scalable mobile data capabilities, and a first look at the mobile advertising platform’s new products,” according to a press release. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DeBqA0020P0WoAHJ00> . 

Privacy Explainer 

Facebook tweaked its terms and policies on Thursday with the addition of a “Privacy Basics” page, one year after similar updates came to light. “People sometimes ask how their information is shared with advertisers,” Chief Privacy Officer Erin Egan writes in a blog  <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqKP04A0LB0WAH02e0000pD> post. “Nothing is changing with these updates—we help advertisers reach people with relevant ads without telling them who you are.” There’s new info on how Facebook gathers and uses location data, and a notable update gives users more agency over the ads they see – or choose not to see – when moving from desktop to Facebook’s mobile app. The NYT has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4H0L0P00qD002LBW0qAe> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Boutique Tech 

High-end fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff is making brick-and-mortar look more like the Internet with new stores in New York and San Francisco this month. The two locations will be outfitted with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tech, powered by eBay, that tracks the items customers try on or interact with. RFID technology can provide store operators with real-time data on inventory, and will also be installed in fitting rooms to facilitate customer support. “There are critical moments where [consumers] are going to buy something, or they are going to leave,” said Healey Cypher, head of retail innovation at eBay. “We’re applying that exact same logic to the physical world.” The WSJ has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DeBqA0020P0W7ADo00> . 

DoubleClick’s Global Outage 

DoubleClick for Publishers was down for 90 minutes on Wednesday, resulting in millions in lost revenue to more than 50,000 publishers. In a tweet <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4D0p0P00qD002LBW08Ae> , DoubleClick head of display Neal Mohan called the incident the “[f]irst global DFP outage in many, many years.” Google said in its blog post, “Google’s ad server DoubleClick for Publishers experienced an outage this morning impacting publishers globally, across their video, display, native and mobile formats. Our team has worked quickly to fix the software bug, and DFP is now back up and running, so our publisher partners can return to funding their content.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tq0WD0P0e000DB920L4qAA0>  

PII Concerns Rampant 

Research from Pew suggests Americans are fretful about their personal data. Of 607 adults surveyed, 91% said they agree or strongly agree that consumers have lost control of how companies are collecting and using personal data. And 80% of those surveyed who use social networking sites are concerned about how third parties like advertisers or businesses access data. But 55% of respondents said they’re willing to share personal data with third parties in exchange for free online services. “Yet, even as Americans express concern about government access to their data, they feel as though government could do more to regulate what advertisers do with their personal information.” Read the  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0erA0000q0Da20LAWD> report. 

Nuthin’ But Jet Set 

In a play to capture more mobile bookings (25% of the travel market today), travel ad company ADARA is aggregating all of its travel-related data in a cross-device database offering called Magellan. According to a press release, “ADARA Magellan … leverages more than 300 million monthly active uniques, 5 billion annual travel searches and 250 million annual travel bookings to provide a full view of a traveler’s purchase behavior.” Hit the flyers on their phones.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Coming Up Roses 

Six weeks after bringing it to market, Facebook is crowing about marketer migrations to its rebuilt Atlas ad server. 1-800-Flowers was the first marketer to switch to the new product a year ago, the company notes in a blog post. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqOB0e2LW004D0P0AAC0y00>  Speaking with AdExchanger, the brand’s director of online marketing, Craig Shiffrin, highlighted the platform’s cross-device chops <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPeD0yq0AD00B4P020W0> . “One of the key elements we are most excited about is being able to look at the people based measurement outside of the cookie-based tracking solution,” he said. 

Bull In A China Shop 

Alibaba drew “Singles’ Day” sales of $9.3 billion, easily breaking the record for this romantic 24-hour shopping holiday while showing Alibaba’s immense clout with Chinese shoppers. Alibaba invented the holiday back in 2009, and copyrighted the term “Double 11” three years later to preserve its commercial potential. “You're seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer," said Joe Tsai, Alibaba Group's executive vice chairman. ”We really are witnessing history here because we are seeing the shift of the economy from focused on the state sector to consumption." And think of all that transaction data, owned by one seller. More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0EyeWPQ0A00>  

Pre-Keyword Discovery 

Pinterest wants to redefine how the industry perceives search, its head of engineering told Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqRB0e2LW004D0P0AAF0y00> . "Today when we think of retrieving information, we think of search," Michael Lopp said. "If you don’t have a keyword though, you’re out of luck. If you want to browse, search engines are the wrong tool. We call this the discovery problem. There's a big opportunity to help people browse and discover ideas and projects before they're ready for search phase." Pinterest controls 23% of referral traffic to ecommerce sites. Pinterest: finding things you never knew you needed. 

Post-Beacon Tech 

Mobile tech company Beintoo has partnered with Gimble on a beacon platform for agencies, retailers and brands. The tech reads like cookies for mobile, dropped into a user's smartphone after an opt-in and then fed into a DSP. “We have to tap into the programmatic ecosystem that already exists,” Beintoo CEO Antonio Tomarchio told MediaPost. “This is a proximity-based audience. It’s more branding-related and based on more than location.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/uG0000DB4L0A0S02yPqWAe0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Higher Standard For ‘In View’ 

Unilever wants to upwardly define the viewable impression. Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqUB0e2LW004D0P0AAO0s00>  that the CPG giant -- along with Mindshare/GroupM -- are insisting that an ad be 100% in-view before it is counted. That’s tougher than the industrywide Making Measurement Make Sense (3MS) standard of 50% in-view for one second. "Unilever and GroupM are both organizations that actively participated in 3MS," bemoaned IAB’s Sherrill Mane. "It's really a shame, because you want to start somewhere and build, not say we did this hard work but I don't care.” 

Private TV Exchanges Cont. 

TV companies are adopting private exchanges for their digital video ad space, but it’s not pure automation. “This is not a giant machine that everyone just plugs into. … It still requires intelligent dialogue with clients and agency partners on how we can add value and help them accomplish their media objectives in a more meaningful way,” NBCU digital strategy exec Krishan Bhatia tells Broadcasting & Cable. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0eV0B4L0P2AAP00q0Ds00>  Buyers are ready. “We’ve been very vocal about moving to private marketplaces where we can have the controls in place to make sure clients are actually getting what they’re paying for,” said GroupM’s chief negotiating officer, Rino Scanzoni. Pair with AdExchanger’s interview with Bhatia. <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PWBQD000qA2s04L0e>  

Publishing + Commerce 

Lucky Magazine plunged deeper into commerce when it spun off from Condé Nast and merged with online retailer BeachMint. Now, the publisher claims its independence is driving ad revenue. “Our biggest revenue stream is advertising, but the advertising market has changed, and it's going to continue to change,” said The Lucky Group’s president, Gillian Gorman Round. “So the fact that we are our own company allows us to work in a different way with the advertising community. We own our own engineering, we own our own data. We will understand everything about our customer, which is incredibly powerful for our advertisers.” Read on via Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0XL0000sP02BAqDe0R40A> . 

Opera’s Next Act 

Opera Software’s mobile browsers will reach millions of new consumers through a deal with Microsoft, which owns the Nokia device business. Opera’s CEO Lars Boilesen tells The Wall Street Journal that “there are about 100 million Nokia handset owners — a fourth of them in India — using Nokia’s Xpress Web browser who will now be migrated to Opera’s browsers.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Be00YW2A000040sB0DSLPqA>  Opera has a large advertising subsidiary, Opera MediaWorks.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Missing Pieces 

Speaking to The Drum at the Web Summit in Dublin late last week, Google Global CMO Lorraine Twohill said the company wants to spend 60% of its digital marketing budget programmatically. “There’s things in programmatic that aren’t quite there yet,” Twohill said. “I really care about ads where people can play and engage so skippable ads, mutable ads; programmatic doesn’t support that yet. I care about cost-per-click, programmatic doesn’t support that yet. I assume all this will come, I think it’s inevitable, but until all those things are there it’s hard for me to get to 60 per cent but we’re moving as fast as we can.” Twohill didn’t offer a definitive timeline, but did say she believes that all advertising will become programmatic eventually. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP01402q0L0AB0De00Ap4> . 

Dark Trading In Chinatown 

Bloomberg shines a floodlight on arbitrage in ad exchanges, and taps two anonymous traders who work out of New York’s Chinatown and claim to generate margins as high as 60%, and tens of thousands in revenue daily. As exchanges become increasingly interconnected, it’s getting more difficult to detect discrepancies and inefficiencies in price, according to AppNexus’ marketing chief, Pat McCarthy. “It definitely still happens,” McCarthy said. “I don’t really know offhand how prevalent that is at this time.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ap0504WB200AePq00L020DA> . 

Kraft Cuts Agency Roster 

Kraft is dropping some agencies, and consolidating its creative business with McGarryBowen, Leo Burnett, Taxi and CP&B, Crain’s Chicago Business reported. According to the company, the decision will "align our brands more strategically with the particular strengths of agencies on our roster.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Be006W2A000040pB0D3LPqA> . Kraft, an early brand adopter of programmatic, may be slimming down to bolster automation – handled through Starcom. CMO Deanie Elsner articulated the company’s first-party data vision in a presentation at the ANA Masters of Marketing show. AdExchanger story. <http://go.adexchanger.com/m000072040qAeLPDBp40WA0>  Kraft is cutting business ties with Droga5, VSA Partners, TBWA, The Martin Agency, Lopez Negrete Communications, Roberts & Langer and Wieden & Kennedy. 

Made By Hulu 

Unlike most of its competitors, Hulu isn’t hopping on the branded-content bandwagon. Instead, the digital streaming service is restructuring its brand-content division as its chief of brand content, Bryan Thoensen, heads for the exit. Rather than pitching brands and agencies on producing programs for distribution on Hulu, the company will purportedly focus on selling sponsorships for its original series. “Branded content almost lives in a purgatory between media, creatives and publishers,” 360i CEO Sarah Hofstetter told Ad Age. “It's smart because it ties to content, but everybody and nobody owns it, which means everybody or nobody will buy it.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/o0250008p00ePW04DABAqL0> . 

Sapient’s Net Income Dips 

Hot on the heels of Publicis’ pending $3.7 billion acquisition bid, Sapient reported a 15% fall in net income during 2014’s Q3. The digital agency issued a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00906L0pW00AD2q0eA04>  on Friday detailing its earnings, in lieu of hosting a call with investors. “While one quarter does not necessarily make for a long-term trend, coming as close as it does to the timing of the transaction, without any indication of the weaker quarterly results to come days later, is potentially alarming,” wrote Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser in a report on Sapient’s results, adding that the “growth of SapientNitro, whose activities are primarily digital, compares unfavorably this quarter with most of the other agency holding companies whose activities are not commonly viewed as such." Despite the bleak profit, revenue in Q3 grew 9%. Read on via AdWeek <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0e07WD0L4Pa0A2q0p0BA00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Havas Pushes ‘Integration’ 

Havas reported 6% organic growth on Thursday, with revenues hitting $555 million for 2014’s third quarter. CEO Yannick Bolloré was hesitant to touch on rival Publicis’ recent acquisition of tech-focused agency Sapient, but told analysts on the call, “We are pursuing a different strategy -- to integrate – because we believe the customer journey is not different in a digital world. We need to be able to deliver networks who are completely fluent in traditional, digital and mobile to meet our clients' expectations and so far we are very satisfied with the results of our strategy based on integration.” Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0e00jq7a> . 

Right-Sizing Twitter Spend 

One year after its IPO, Twitter hasn’t kept pace with the digital ad growth shown by competitors Facebook and Google, The Economist points out. While revenues have quadrupled since 2012 and its market cap is $25 billion, user growth has slowed in recent months. “Twitter has developed into an indispensable media outlet for us, but there are different levels of indispensability,” said OMD Worldwide Chief Digital Officer Ben Winkler. “Both wiper fluid and gasoline are indispensable, but they don’t get the same share of wallet.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWb40080ABD00j0eL02P0Aq> . 

Dentsu’s Fetching Buy 

Detsu Aegis Network snapped up mobile agency network Fetch on Thursday for an estimated $48 million. Fetch is headquartered in London with offices in San Francisco, Berlin and Hong Kong. Head count is 96. Fetch management will report to Dentsu CEO Robert Horler. In a statement, Horler said, “Growing our digital profile across all capabilities is one of our five strategic priorities and this deal clearly recognizes the potential we see in both Fetch and the wider mobile market.” All eyes on mobile. More in The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0jA0DB0Wc2Lq00eA0094P0> . 

The Other Weather 

Weather media company AccuWeather tapped Lotame to support ad personalization and targeting. The partnership rolls together Lotame’s audience data and AccuWeather’s weather prediction, and aims to hone in on demographic and purchase intent data points. The companies said Lotame “gives AccuWeather deep, unified views of their mobile and web audience, drawn from a special blend of first-, second-, and third-party sources.” Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/FeDBL00da0W0P2jq000AA04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

IPG For Sale? 

The Wall Street Journal has learned that Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund, is pushing for board seats at Interpublic Group (IPG). Elliott owns a 6.7% stake in the advertising holding company and purportedly wants IPG to sell soon. Investors had pinned Publicis as a potential IPG buyer, but that seems unlikely after Publicis’ acquisition of Sapient <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4e0A0P00qD002LBW0IAe> . “Publicis—while not impossible that they might do something at some point in the future—is pretty clear in putting forward it’s not going to do anything anytime soon,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser told The Wall Street Journal. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqBP04A0LB0WAe02e0000JD> . 

Social Commerce Swells 

Research from BI Intelligence details how social media is impacting the path to purchase. The findings suggest that the volume of social commerce is growing, and sales from social commerce grew three times the rate of overall ecommerce. Due to its sheer size, Facebook is the leading platform for social commerce referrals and sales, followed by Twitter and Pinterest. The research suggests conversion rates will improve as Twitter and Facebook cement their buy buttons. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/yeeWDqP00A0LABK04C00020> . Pair with AdExchanger’s “The Buy Button Buy-In <http://go.adexchanger.com/TD0We0P0e000DBL20L4qAA0> .” 

Dynamic Dish 

Dish network is moving forward with plans to include dynamic ad insertion in its forthcoming digital TV service, Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00e0Me0WEDP0L0A00> , despite some minor snags. "I think the advertising piece of OTT is materially higher than it is in linear TV,” Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said, “where in the advent of DVRs … people do skip commercials and so rather than fight the rhythm and swim upstream with that, we'd rather come up with a different dynamic that attacks it in a different way.” With its data, Dish claims it will soon be able to stream personalized ads to every viewer. “We can start moving into some of the categories that the Facebooks and the Googles of the world are taking advantage of today,” Ergen added. 

Rocky Mobile Road 

Online coupon aggregator RetailMeNot had a rocky third quarter, namely due to mobile growing pains and the departure of its CFO. RetailMeNot’s mobile traffic has soared. It represented almost 40% of total traffic this quarter. But during the company’s Q3 earnings call this week, CEO Cotter Cunningham said mobile monetization has not kept up. “In many cases, we don’t believe we’re getting full credit for the true value we’re driving,” said Cunningham. Read the earnings release <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0eqW0D00FANB0e4PA> . And more in The Street. <http://go.adexchanger.com/TG0We0P0e000DBO20L4qAA0>  The mobile cookie: not yet baked. 

Facebook Ads Made Easy 

Red Hot Labs released a tool called Toro to facilitate how app and game developers buy Facebook ads. According to the San Francisco-based startup, Toro cuts the cost of locking in a mobile user by 40%. “Toro has been an invaluable asset as we grow our audience across mobile,” said Vivek Patel, co-founder of Sosh, an events discovery app and early adopter of Toro. “In Toro, we found a product that is fast, insanely simple to use and yet powerful enough to give us all the metrics we need to drive mobile performance campaigns.” Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PeH00q2P0e> more via VentureBeat.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Business Is Booming 

Advertising technology is a standalone industry, and it’s growing. ABI Research projects that independent ad tech is on a $6 billion run rate for the year and it has shown 52% annual growth since 2011. “The moral may be similar to that told of Levi Strauss in the Gold Rush: selling tools to those hunting for gold can be a good and sustainable business,” said ABI research practice director Sam Rosen. ABI highlights the uptick in acquisitions by consumer platform companies (think Facebook/LiveRail, Twitter/MoPub, Yahoo/Flurr, and AOL/Adap.tv). “The real battle lines are drawn between the publisher’s in-house platforms, and those independents that will help brands, advertisers and agencies to navigate the complex landscape without putting all their eggs in one basket.” Read on. <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PH40a0DvAeq2>  

Fraud = Opportunity? 

Rocket Fuel released a free tool called Traffic Scanner that measures and monitors a campaign’s traffic quality. It’s not intended to replace a marketer’s preferred anti-fraud vendor, said Ari Levenfeld, senior director of privacy and inventory quality. Rather, “We believe the industry needs a freely available ‘first look at the numbers’ solution that cuts through the fear, uncertainty and doubt, and leads to increased trust and value in the ecosystem.” It’s fraud detection as differentiator. More via the Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00aI0ALAWPweB02q000> . 

Sir Martin Speaks 

Are brands taking programmatic in-house? Some agencies have pushed back forcefully against the trend. WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrell has been among the most vocal. “There will be clients, as there have always been in traditional media buying, that do their own planning and buying,” he told Business Insider. “The issue is whether an in-house agency, particularly in the technology area, can continue to advance their technology in an effective way, and whether the people who work in an in-house agency will be sufficiently challenged over the long and medium-term to continue to work then.” Sorrell said ad tech is the most exciting area WPP has explored in the last two or three years.

Location Data Query 

Does hyperlocal advertising to mobile devices even work? Adweek looks at the value of location data in the mobile media question, but answers are evasive. “[With] one of the big players in this space, we saw 85 percent of all impressions [in a campaign] served were not within the location that we specified for our client," said Jon Hook, head of mobile at MediaCom International. "I'm not talking about minor discrepancies – these are significant discrepancies that we're seeing." Other marketers are concerned about the absence of methods to verify location data. Clarity could come in 2015, when the Mobile Marketing Association is expected to release standards that define location data. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LaK2yADP0e00A0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Mobile Fraud Concerns Swell 

Fraudsters see a potentially lucrative opportunity as mobile ad budgets grow. The cookie-less environment and separate standards create vulnerabilities in the channel, DigitasLBi CIO Adam Shlachter told Adweek. But with lower ad rates for mobile than for desktop, some industry execs aren’t worried just yet. "If I were going to try to defraud someone, I would be looking to inflate PC impressions because those are more sellable in the marketplace," said Evolve Media President Brian Fitzgerald. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00Z0hL04W00AD2q0eA04> . 

German Data Regulations Cont. 

Legislators have drafted a new Internet security law that could threaten US tech companies’ presence in Germany’s digital marketplace, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pi4040D0Aeq2> . The German government is purportedly also considering stipulating that all German Internet data be stored locally, which would box out major cloud tech enterprises. The news does not sit well with software companies such as SAP that have heavy global operations. “National solutions for cloud computing are the wrong path,” said SAP CFO Luka Mucic. “We must work with international partners like the US and simplify the regulatory framework.” 

Native Sells 

Native advertising boosted publisher revenues in the third quarter, according to Ad Age. The New York Times, for instance, saw a 16.5% increase in digital ad revenue in Q3, which VP of advertising Meredith Kopit Levien attributed to Paid Post, the NYT’s sponsored content platform. Sponsored mobile ads contributed to Facebook’s 64% spike in ad sales, and Twitter’s ad revenue jumped an impressive 109%. But native advertising isn’t doing wonders for all media properties (*cough* Yahoo). Tumblr’s parent company saw a dip in its premium display ads during Q3, as advertisers turned to its less costly native Stream Ads. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/FeDBL00j10W0P24q000AA04> . 

LinkedIn Vs. Salesforce 

Writing for TechCrunch, Infer CEO Vik Singh suggests LinkedIn has the data and resources to rival Salesforce and Marketo. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DeBqA0020P0WkA4200> . Singh’s hypothetical: Say a company were to include JavaScript from LinkedIn on its website. The company could track signed-in LinkedIn users who visit their site, capturing a potential customer base that looks but won’t touch contact forms. The challenge for LinkedIn would be integrating with back-office applications for web analytics, lead routing, customer-relationship management triggers and more. “Although the risks of moving into the sales and marketing space are high given the safeties LinkedIn enjoys today, the market is just too lucrative to ignore,” writes Singh.

Score (Two?) For Social 

Social Reality, the developer of exchange-based ads platform and social marketing tool GroupAd, secured a $20 million credit facility from a Chicago-based asset-management firm, along with $5 million in new equity financing from Siskey Capital.

Razorfish Headwinds 

It’s been a tough few months for Public’s digital arm Razorfish, with Maurice Lévy blaming the holding company’s weak Q3 results on key client losses at the agency. The plot thickened with Publicis’ acquisition of Sapient <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0e0eWD0L4PW0A2q040BA00> . And with Razorfish CEO Pete Stein rumored to be on his way out, Dstillery snapped up Razorfish VP of media Julie Weitzner <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0eqW0D006AoB044PA>  on Monday. Razorfish may soon lose more executive leadership as it’s rolled into Rosetta and Nurun, and rebranded Razorfish Global under Tom Adamski. Adamski will in turn report to Alan Herrick, head of the new Publicis.Sapient digital and technology unit.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Scary Masks 

The ability to cloak an ad’s domain information is often cited as a major reason fraud persists. The practice enables undesirable properties (porn, piracy, ad farms, etc.) to masquerade as YouTube or The Washington Post, for example. DoubleVerify estimates that 23% of ads bought programmatically land on URL-masked sites, and Ghostery places that figure number to 40%. “It makes it very difficult to determine … in what context was this ad ultimately served," explained John Murphy, a traffic quality exec for OpenX. “We see it as a major threat to the validity and the integrity of the exchanges out there.” Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqoB0d2LW004D0P0AAM0Z00> . 

Sir Martin Smiles 

WPP Group CEO Martin Sorrell touched on the holding company’s tech-investment strategy during the Q3 earnings call. Never one to miss an opportunity to swipe at competitors, Sorrell claimed WPP’s investment in AppNexus sparked "considerable … consternation and disruption” among its rivals. As reported by Business Insider, Publicis Groupe had been working on an AppNexus deal in Europe, and Omnicom "would very much like to establish a relationship with AppNexus.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00ZN0ALAWPpdB02q000>  Separately, WPP claims that, based on market comparisons, Xaxis would be valued at $4 billion if it were a standalone company.

TV Automation Down Under 

AOL Platforms partnered with Aussie media company Multi Channel Network (MCN) to pilot a programmatic private marketplace for TV. According to the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0dr0B4L0P2AAP00q0DZ00> , the effort is designed to “greatly advance the $4 billion TV industry in Australia towards unified ad sales across TV and digital screens.” MCN group sales and marketing director Mark Frain said, “More than two years of industry research and consultation tells us automation and programmatic TV are exactly what the Australian TV industry needs to stay relevant in this digitally driven environment.” 

Cannes + Ad Tech 

Cannes is expanding with a new "festival within the festival” – called Lions Innovation – that will last two days and focus on the interplay of data, technology and creativity. Ad tech has been a growing presence at the 62-year-old event in recent years. The problem, for Cannes event organizers anyway, is that much of that presence has been at private events, not at the official venue, the Palais des Festival.
