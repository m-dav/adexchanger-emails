 <http://go.adexchanger.com/gg0D40L0q20ABA0AW000i2P> Programmatic Drives 10-15% of NBCUniversal’s Total Digital Upfront Business
Prior to the upfronts, the company expected to secure 50% of commitments on a “converged” basis, with elements of both TV and digital in a single deal. In this most recent upfront, NBCUniversal’s digital business grew 50% and, of that growth, programmatic represented 40%.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PmBkD000qA2204L0A> Data-Driven Thinking column...Brands And Agencies Should Practice Safe Advertising With Google by Zvika Netter, Innovid
Google appears to be creating a walled garden that eliminates relationships with tech companies or agencies that do not currently sit on its platform. This essentially forces these companies to make a choice: rely on Google for their tech stacks or lose access to valuable inventory.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02l000n200APW04DABAqL0> Zipcar Is Not Keen On Black Boxes
"[We could have] probably cobbled together some kind of ad tech stack ourselves – I actually got pressure to do that – but take one look at the LUMAscape and you start to cry," Zipcar's Andrew Daley said. "We didn’t want to go there."

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DmA02000BW20q4AoLP0A> Kenya Airways Fuels With Data To Lift Marketing
"The journey is ongoing to continuously enrich the data from various sources and eventually have a segmentation model that focuses on 80/20 and 360-degree view of customers that will deliver a superior and consistent experience across the customer journey," Julie Mandu-Wijenje, Kenya Airways, said.

As an industry, we have a lot to be proud of, but we can’t be so focused on self-congratulatory back-slapping that we forget we have a lot of work to do both to perfect our strategies and products and to educate the newbies.

In order to get TAG’ed, as TAG playfully calls it, applicants will have to submit to a background check and pony up proof to show that they are who they say they are, including business info like tax ID and certificate of incorporation.

News Round Up

Get Off The Bench

Comcast’s broadcast advertising has been hit hard by cord cutting, with sluggish or nonexistent growth across many properties, but sports investments continue to float legacy TV. The Wall Street Journal’s Steven Perlberg says <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqsP04A0LB0WA202A0000qD>  NBC’s $950M purchase of the English Premier League rights is “starting to look like one of the shrewdest deals in media.” Soccer in particular has drawn a young, coveted audience. In another WSJ article, Nathalie Tadena cites NBC’s Nascar deal as having “helped offset the impact of rating declines across several networks.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0A002qtr> .

Search Engine Apptimization

Google has been hustling to index app pages and link to them in its search results, but many see a big market opening for a search engine for the app world. Conor Dougherty reports for the NYT on Relcy, one of many startups (like Button and URX) that are trying to unearth consumer search and intent for apps. These startups, like their counterparts in measurement and media buying, pitch themselves as neutral partners. (Will Google favor its own video services over Facebook or Hulu? Its own maps over preferred partners?) Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0uL00002P02BAqDA0s40A> .

Android vs. iOS

Writing for App Developer Magazine, Stuart Parkerson explores the drivers of app download growth in the Android and iOS environments. He cites App Annie’s Q3 Market Report data finding the Google Play store gets 90% more global downloads, and that gap is extending in Google’s favor. However, even as Google expands its lead in overall users and downloads, Apple’s App Store and in-app revenue is pulling away from Android. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0tAA00v2D0AP00040> .

Calling Bullshit

Broadcast execs are starting to push back on the credibility of claims of TV-caliber audiences <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DABqA0020P0WuA2w00>  from the likes of Facebook, Google and Snapchat. Joe Marchese has a unique perspective, as he came to 21st Century Fox via the acquisition of his ad tech firm, TrueX, last year. In  <http://go.adexchanger.com/BA00xW2A0000402B0DvLPqA> a Medium post, Marchese identifies some critical flaws in the platform argument. YouTube or Facebook videos may pull in tens of millions of views, but a TV show (he uses the World Series as an example) has a single, simultaneous audience.

News Round Up

You Listening, Internet?

Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting unit says it will begin reducing commercial minutes across its channels, according to Steven Perlberg at The Wall Street Journal. Don’t necessarily expect a revenue drop-off, as the networks are pitching the scarcer ads by saying “it will be a premium value, and there will be a premium price associated with it,” according to Turner ad exec Joe Hogan. There’s a growing sense that fewer ads will pay higher dividends for TV broadcasters. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4Z0A0P00qD002LBW0CAz> .

A Whole New Outlook

Once the market bellwether, AOL email has fizzled into obscurity. But the company announced on Wednesday <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PBDZA40LzB00DA>  the return of Alto, its account management system, because even if nobody uses an AOL email address, people still might need a product to help manage their profligate personal, business and throwaway accounts. Yahoo also recently unveiled a major overhaul <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LZE2CADP0z00A0>  of its email account services. It isn’t just new players like Slack that see an opportunity to capture business and personal email management in a single app as users migrate to mobile.

There’s Data Everywhere

Verizon has put huge resources into its cross-channel measurement capabilities recently, and now you can add a whole new channel the company plans to bring into its data collective: Internet of Things. “We really believe the (IoT) market is underserved," said Mike Lanman, Verizon SVP of enterprise products, about the lack of big-name interest in the space. (Alphabet would probably disagree.) According to Maureen Morrison at Ad Age, expect Verizon to focus on products that will allow them to pull data from connected devices, including cars, kitchen appliances and health care.

Mobile DSP On A Hiring Spree

Adelphic is beefing up its ranks. The mobile DSP <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PEBGD000qA2Z04L0z>  announced three high-profile hires on Wednesday – Nick Mills as GM of EMEA (formerly Facebook’s head of sales for Atlas in the UK); Gina Kim as VP of biz dev (joining from Oracle, where she served as head of DMP sales for the marketing cloud); and Yael Avidan as VP of product (coming off a product director stint at Yahoo). Adelphic co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Jennifer Lum told AdExchanger the hires are part of the company’s plan to expand its cross-device features and open up global access to new data sets and channels beyond mobile, desktop and connected TV.

"We’re using machine learning to predict and assign political preference to users," said Eric Hoppe, Pandora’s group product manager. "Fundamentally, it’s done on a scale from zero to one – if we don’t have strong predictive power in a certain case, we need to find additional data points to use."

"You can’t operate as a closed system anymore," Oracle's John Stetic said.

News Round Up

Weather Nears Sale To IBM

IBM is near a deal to acquire digital and data assets of The Weather Company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. “IBM is particularly interested in Weather Co.’s forecasting group, WSI. That division houses technology and weather data that the Weather Co. collects, manipulates and licenses to companies ranging from airlines to utility companies to insurance providers.” Oh, and advertisers, courtesy of the Weather FX platform. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000W2Hz0L0B0CA4PDAq> .

Newsletter Alchemy

Lena Dunham’s newsletter, Lenny Letter, struck up a monetization deal with Hearst. In her newsletter announcing the change, Dunham said, “The resources afforded by this partnership simply allow Lenny to exist and to grow.” Hearst will get to publish posts from the newsletter and funnel its readers across related sites, including Elle, Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire. Lenny Letters isn’t a full-blown pub, but it provides a juicy option for Hearst to sell advertisers on campaign extensions. Read more at Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0zD0B4L0I2AAP00q0DW00> .  

Time For Something New

In related female audience news, Time Inc. acquired two sites, xoJane.com and xoVain.com, that cater specifically to younger women. Terms weren’t disclosed, but Jeffrey Trachtenberg of The Wall Street Journal pegs the price at $20 million. The deal comes less than a  month after Time purchased HelloGiggles, a women’s lifestyle site. The xo sites come with relatively small readerships, but the struggling print publisher has pursued a similar strategy with Sports Illustrated, building tangential audiences by buying niche sites.

Data Estate Sale

A&P might be tanking, but the supermarket chain’s data isn’t going down with the ship. The company filed for Chapter 11 in July, and now Tim Baysinger reports for Ad Age that its customer data, websites, social media accounts and more will be chopped up and sold off to the highest bidder. There are no specifics about what data and assets are on the block, but one known quantity is A&P’s loyalty program, which includes the user archive and software for serving targeted coupons. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00F0KL0WW00AD2q0zA04> .

Always More To Discover

Snapchat keeps floating trial balloons in hopes of hitting it off with advertisers. A new offering lets brands effectively create their own “sponsored” publisher channels within the app’s professional content-centric Discover section. Previously they could only target users who follow anointed publisher partners, such as ESPN or BuzzFeed. Re/code’s Kurt Wagner underscores that the offering is still being evaluated, and is not a regular feature. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0zGA0000q0DL20LAWW> . Next pitch: Would you like to boost your brand channel with some paid media?

"It's not like we’ll let ‘traditional’ addressable go first and then programmatic second," Adam Gaynor explained. "Our new system will play out impressions as they are needed in terms of reach and frequency, or depending on the control mechanisms the advertisers set."

Ultimately, if EU policymakers continue down the path of requiring consent for the collection and use of a cookie ID, they are essentially signaling to the marketplace that it should obtain consent as broadly as possible.

News Round Up

Techtonics

Ad Age’s Kate Kaye covers recently accelerated efforts by telcos to monetize the vast mobile audience data they’re sitting on. Verizon, Sprint, Telefonica and other carriers are licensing those data sets for use on platforms run by SAP, IBM, HP and AirSage, among others. “SAP's Consumer Insight 365 ingests regularly updated data representing as many as 300 cellphone events per day for each of the 20 million to 25 million mobile subscribers,” she writes. According to 451 Research, the market for this telco data is expected to go from $24 billion this year to $79 billion by 2020. Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40M0A2R0BCLD0WzP00q0A0> on.

2019: Ad Block Doomsday?

In an Adweek-hosted roundtable Q&A, Washington Post CRO Jed Hartman makes an ominous prediction about the tide of ad blocking. “If nothing stops the trend, it's four years out when ad blocker usage meets average direct sell-through on large websites – nonprogrammatic sell-through – which tends to be the highest CPMs.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DzBqA0020P0WNARD00> .

Brand New Hub

The Twitter drumbeat continues. In its ongoing effort to get more brands to flock to Twitter with their ad dollars in tow, the has expanded its social listening analytics.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqEB0z2LW004D0P0AAO0R00> Blog post. Dubbed Brand Hub, the tool aims to give advertisers a one-stop shop for insights on influencers, geo and demo data, competitive analysis and share of voice, or “TrueVoice,” as Twitter is calling it. It “offers a powerful way for advertisers to measure how their brand and advertising is resonating with customers in real time,” Andrew Bragdon, a product manager for revenue at Twitter, told AdExchanger. Twitter’s looking to prove that tweets leave an impression. <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00RP0ALAWPFzB02q000>  More in Marketing Land.

Learning To Love Digital

Mondelez has cut its TV ad spending by almost half in the past five years, and digital has filled in most of that vacuum (though more experimental opportunities like in-store holograms get a look too). WSJ reporter Suzanne Vranica speaks with Mondelez CMO Dana Anderson on the implications of that shift. It’s an important reminder that from the brand POV, a lot of digital marketing is still in the process of seeing what sticks to the wall.

News Round Up

Only Room For ONE

AOL has long positioned itself as <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLOWC0APzp020qD40>  the open alternative to Facebook or Google, but that’s changed to some extent since the company’s acquisition by Verizon in May. In trying to explain what made AOL so valuable to the telco (all of five months ago), the NYT described <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0DOzWPq0A00>  “its so-called programmatic advertising business, a system that matches online advertisers with consumers across different platforms.” And from the privacy notice <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPzE4B00W000qAO0020ArD>  Verizon just released, it’s clear why AOL’s new role as Verizon’s tech stack necessarily means more restrictive policies.

Moments That Matter

Two weeks after launching “Moments,” Twitter has revealed monetization plans around it.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bz00sW2A000040OB0DFLPqA> Blog post. Pricing for “Promoted Moments” isn’t cited in this Bloomberg writeup <http://go.adexchanger.com/FzDBL00Gt0W0P2Oq000AA04>  from Sarah Frier, but Twitter VP of revenue Matt Derella says the format includes video options, and that sponsored stories will be “really prominently displayed.” The stated goal – though somewhat unambitious – is to eventually have one promoted Moment per day in users’ timelines.

Lean, Mean Ad Machines

Earnings season has surfaced some trouble in agencyland. Even though P&G is upping its working marketing budgets (money spent on media), the brand that The Wall Street Journal’s Nathalie Tadena calls “a bellwether of broader spending trends among big marketers” is scaling back on agency-related outlays. According to Publicis CEO Maurice Levy, automobile, consumer goods and pharmaceuticals sectors companies all withheld ad spending in the latest period.

Data For Better Set Lists

Instead of applause to gauge what songs fans like most, Pandora is offering bands access to its Artist Marketing Platform (AMP). Bands can see what songs listeners are giving a thumbs-up and where fans are located, helping them plan tours and grow their followings. And, of course, use Pandora to advertise their concerts. Pandora bought two companies, business intelligence-focused Next Big Sound and ticket sales platform Ticketfly, to activate AMP. Data, content, commerce – that’s quite the jam.

News Round Up

Laissez Faire

The coming tsunami of political spending has the ad tech world salivating, but it isn’t all positive. Ana Radelat writes for Ad Age that both users and buyers could face a “political crowd out” in 2016. With so many candidates (not to mention outside advocacy groups) and inventory so targeted, the competition for high-value spots on TV and digital will lead to rate hikes and a painful squeeze that will translate into good news for publishers in the form of higher yield. Users will experience that crowd out in the form of too many political ads, which may backfire on candidates or issue campaigns. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DzBqA0020P0WVAHB00> .

Surfacing Intent

Facebook has introduced a consequential change to its search product. The Verge’s Nick Statt writes that Facebook will now index all 2 trillion user posts for real-time and curated search. For instance, a user search for “MLB” could lead to a page that features news specific to your baseball team and interests, with authoritative sources on top and a scroll down to friends’ comments. The change will help Facebook stay on top of Twitter’s real-time curation, and could be a boon to marketers. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/FzDBL00WC0W0P2Hq000AA04> .

Legacy Mags Turn To Ecommerce

Time Inc. will roll out something called People Shop, an online store that will sell lifestyle products and accessories. The goal is to stimulate new revenue following the magazine’s spinoff from Time Warner last year, according to Lucia Moses at Digiday. Time editorial director Jess Cagle says publishers need to cultivate a variety of incremental revenue streams on digital, while “the best we can do with print is to stabilize it.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWH4zA00DL0PB0X2> .

Fake Athletes, Real Dollars

In a few short years, “e-sports” has gone from a niche community of unknown nerds playing video games to a multibillion-dollar marketing vehicle. Video game competitions are steadily gaining steam, with big-dollar interest for streaming and broadcast entertainment. Following Amazon’s purchase of Twitch, Google launched its own “YouTube Gaming <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PzE00q2Y0H> ” group. And it isn’t just digital natives: TBS recently bought the broadcast rights <http://go.adexchanger.com/GzB0AH20DF4ZW0AL0000P0q>  for a professional video game league and Activision, a leading video game company, just launched an e-sports division <http://go.adexchanger.com/lIBqH000LzDP0A2A400000W>  dedicated to streaming opportunities.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0E0P4qA02000WLh0U0AzDB> Quartz Says No To Pre-Roll, And Lincoln’s Along For The Ride
“Despite the fact that the majority of ad dollars are going into the pre-roll bucket, viewers don’t love it,” said Mia Mabanta, director of marketing and revenue products for Quartz. Instead, pre-roll gives advertisers scale through forced views, which aligns with their short-term marketing goals.

News Round Up

Pindow Shopping

People are in a holding pattern when it comes to Pinterest. A leaked forecast <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00sWqA000zPEA05040D2L>  showed revenue going from $170 million to $2.8 billion in the next two years. Garett Sloane reports for Digiday that advertisers are hesitant to put big budgets on Pinterest today, but also excited about the platform’s future. You can buy or build tech stacks and sequential targeting skills, but purchase intent is something a competitor like Facebook can’t replicate. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0tEzWP60A00> .

Nielsen’s Total Approach

Nielsen CEO Mitch Barns talked up Total Audience Measurement – Nielsen’s most daunting development project to date – during the ratings mainstay’s Q3 earnings call. Advertisers need apples-to-apples comparison across TV, digital, VOD and, ultimately, mobile and connected TV devices – and Nielsen wants to supply the tool set. It claims sell-in across most of the top 25 advertisers for its Digital Content Ratings product and, conversely, points to networks like CBS, which are incrementally measuring mobile and online viewing against standard ratings. <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0uEzWP70A00>  More from Barns.

In The Red

YouTube’s new subscription service, YouTube Red, is receiving a ton of press, and The Verve’s Ben Popper has a deep dive. The coverage is mostly optimistic, noting Google’s ambitions to “eventually go head to head with Hulu and Netflix.” There’s a much-needed grain of salt here, though, as Red is at the same price point as Netflix, but where Netflix churns out massively popular original programming, Google’s main selling point is a YouTube experience free of pre-roll annoyance.

Messaging Means Business

Early office collaboration startups Slack and HipChat are contending with a growing number of smaller rivals, each hollowing out a discrete niche. Sean Captain at Fast Company reports on a small selection of those upstarts, and what the monetization are in this hot B2B sector. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DwA02000BWE0q4z9LP0A> .

News Round Up

And The Virtual Pulitzer Goes To...

The New York Times has a well-earned reputation as a digital trailblazer for legacy publishers, which accounts for all the raised eyebrows when America’s paper of record announced a virtual reality film (on child refugees displaced by war) produced in partnership with Google. NYT Executive Editor Dean Baquet calls it “the first critical, serious piece of journalism using virtual reality.” VR is still more of a one-off gimmick than a legit channel for commerce or marketing, but maybe journalism will bring the needed gravitas. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB2000ABz0A200WL4qPs00> .

It’s About Time (And Measurement)

Adweek’s Jason Lynch demos Nielsen’s “total audience measurement,” which is finally ready for its close-up after what seems like an eternity in development. The offering wraps together audiences for streaming and linear TV, DVR, video on demand, tablets, PC and mobile. Lynch finds a product that broadcasters in particular will love, as it surfaces discrete segments such as fans who stream shows on digital channels and loyal viewers who never see an episode live. The move comes amid a series <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00BA0L0Dt00zB2qW0A3P04>  of competitive announcements <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00BA0L0Du00zB2qW0A4P04>  regarding cross-platform metrics.

Home Field Advantage

German telco giant Deutsche Telekom is considering (and expected to bring) an antitrust case against Google regarding the search engine’s market dominance. New York Times reporter Mark Scott broke the news that Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile in the US, will go after Google for supposedly unfairly advantaging its own products. Google’s Chrome or Search products can, for instance, favor Google Maps when giving directions. These are pretty standard practices in the US, but European companies have kicked and screamed for years about Silicon Valley squeezing out regional competitors. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DwA02000BWB0q4z6LP0A> .

Old Dog, New Tricks

Comcast, learning from the likes of Facebook and Google, is turning to its “potential treasure trove of data” to unleash ad dollars. The access provider has discussed licensing its data with measurement firms and networks like ESPN, Discovery and Turner. The WSJ reports the company rejected a $100 million exclusive offer from Nielsen in favor of sharing the pie, as the telco sees better returns down the road if it can elevate TV back above digital, and not just get one big payout upfront.

News Round Up

Riding Off Into The Sunset (Again)

Well, that didn’t take long. In the wake of the completion of Millennial Media’s sale to AOL, CEO Michael Barrett, President Jason Kelly and SVP of business services Marc Theermann have all formally exited the company. Read the SEC filing. <http://go.adexchanger.com/i1xW00BzPvL00A000Dq2A04>  If it feels like you’ve heard this one before, recall that Barrett, Kelly and Theermann all held senior roles with Admeld before Google bought and absorbed that company.

Moment Of Silence

Razorfish global CEO Tom Adamski has passed away after a battle with cancer. Adamski was 43 years old and sat on Publicis Groupe’s P12 executive committee of advisers to CEO Maurice Levy. He was a veteran of digital agencies including Rosetta and Level Studios, overseeing work for the likes of Apple, Samsung and Aetna. Levy said in a statement, "Tom was an important part of the Publicis family for many years … and left a significant mark on the Groupe. While we mourn the loss of Tom, we honor his joie de vivre.” More from Ad Age’s Alexandra Bruell <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4x020P00qD002LBW0wAz> .

Tremors Along Digital Fault Lines

A pair of New York Times reporters dug into the ongoing tug-of-war between apps and the web, where publishers may feel more like the rope than the tuggers. The difficulty comes from major platforms like Google and Apple, which tweak their products and algorithms to prod users (and therefore publishers) in one direction or another. Creative agencies also struggle as the need for personalization across fragmented channels becomes more pressing (a 30-second pre-roll, a three-second silent autoplay ad, a vertical five-second skippable pre-roll and so on). It’s important to bear in mind that the kings and queens in this cold war have considerable skin in the game too. After all, Google’s Chrome, Gmail, YouTube and Maps are some of the most downloaded apps ever, and Facebook’s desktop site is second only to Google in total traffic. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0zAA30Dxx00> .

A Stream … Or A Trickle?

YouTube has signed some early content partners for an upcoming streaming subscription service (for around $10 per month) but those players are only reluctantly on board, Mike Shields and Shalini Ramachandran write for The Wall Street Journal. Media partners, including Turner Cable, NBC and Fox Sports, will get 55% of overall subscription revenue, split based on their share of video viewership. The WSJ cites some media execs who feel “strong-armed by YouTube into participating.” If the service doesn’t perform look for those currently anonymous naysayers to speak up. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0P4ByD000qA2x04L0z> .

New Yahoo Exodus?

A pair of senior defections raise the spectre of a new talent retention crisis at Yahoo. The company’s chief development officer, Jacqueline Reses, and its marketing partnerships leader, Lisa Licht, have flown the coop. Re/code’s Kara Swisher says the luster is coming off CEO Marissa Mayer’s company turnaround.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLxWz0APz5020qD40> More. The exits follow some on the ad platforms side, including Ned Brody and Scott Burke.

News Round Up

Been Done

In-app ad blocker Been Choice has decided to call it a day – on in-app ad blocking, that is. After getting pulled from the App Store over what Apple deemed a security issue, co-founder Dave Yoon and his team resubmitted the app without blocking Pinterest, Facebook and others. Following a week of “in review” purgatory, Yoon and company are retracting their app from review and resubmitting a version that focuses on Safari, working within the existing framework for blocking in iOS 9. In other words, another version of <http://go.adexchanger.com/Au0v04WB200AzPq00L020DA>  Crystal, et al. But “even with just Safari, choice is better than no choice, we think,” Yoon told AdExchanger. Pair with <http://go.adexchanger.com/r4030A2u0BwLD0WzP00q0A0>  AdExchanger’s Yoon Q&A.

Pinning Your Hopes

TechCrunch got a hold of Pinterest’s internal revenue and growth forecasts, and whoa boy are they optimistic. By the end of this year, Pinterest expects to have about 151 million users and $169 million in revenue. But by 2018, the social media platform projects 329 million users and $2.8 billion in revenue. Andreessen Horowitz used those figures to solicit co-investors at a $11 billion valuation earlier this year. It remains to be seen how well Pinterest can spin its natural resources (shopping intent and a core of loyal female users) into revenue. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lu42xADP0z00A0> .

Digital Wins When It Disappears

At this year’s ANA Masters of Marketing conference, some CMOs (notably <http://go.adexchanger.com/qzAW0A0DLy004u02B0P500q>  Pepsi’s Bradley Jakeman) called for a moratorium on “digital marketing,” as it’s just marketing now. It’s a similar theme we’ve seen from retailers, who in a few years have shifted from an in-store vs. online perspective to omnichannel. Tom Goodwin, a Havas SVP, writes for The Guardian that “our obsession with the divide between non-digital and digital media is limiting marketers thinking.” Apparently, the idea is catching on. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P640u0DzAzq2> .

Finger On The Pulse

If you’ve wondered why tech has eyeballed health care so intensely (from the controversial startup  <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqAP04A0LB0WAu02z00007D> Theranos to Alphabet’s massive life sciences investments), Bloomberg View columnist Peter Orszag has a telling graph <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lu82BADP0z00A0> . In the past decade, the top 10% of companies in terms of return on capital have skyrocketed … and those companies are either in health care or information technology. Facebook, Apple and Google have all pivoted into health  <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P940u0DCAzq2> care recently. There are far more profitable ways than advertising for companies to monetize intimate knowledge of their users.

News Round Up

Minority Report For Realz

Forget machine learning; the new buzzword is AI. Publicis’ Sapient division, which focuses on digital tech, acquired a minority stake in the artificial intelligence company Lucid on Thursday. The goal is to create detailed histories of consumer buying patterns in order to understand years-long shifts in who buys a certain brand’s product. There’s ultimately an attribution play here, as better knowledge would enable sharper measurement of branding campaigns. Read the announcement <http://go.adexchanger.com/iCoW00BzPfL00A000Dq2A04> .

Facebook Seeks News Angle

Facebook is working on an app, Notify, that allows users to create a curated feed of all the news they’d like to follow. So instead of getting sucked into watching a Facebook trending story like “Rat vs. Pigeon” (horrifying), someone can go to the app instead and get Huffington Post’s updates on the 2016 election. This might be the next logical step to bring publisher revenue to Facebook after it gets the Instant Articles kinks worked out. Read The Awl’s  <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0o0P4qA02000WLg0D0AzDB> analysis.

Head In The Clouds

Walmart will be open-sourcing the code from OneOps, a cloud-management company it purchased in 2013. Walmart’s traffic and activity is literally too big for one cloud partner (like Microsoft and Rackspace), so it needs to jump between clouds. But there are big advantages in avoiding “Cloud Lock-in” for smaller ecommerce players too, says Steve Lohr at The New York Times. And now Walmart will be helping competitors to do the same. Although wouldn’t you know it, the move undercuts one of Amazon’s fastest-growing businesses. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/iEoW00BzPhL00A000Dq2A04> .

Bird’s Eye View

Twitter is launching conversion lift reports to help advertisers measure the incremental impact of their Twitter campaigns on the bottom line. Blog post. <http://go.adexchanger.com/qzAW0A0DLF004o02B0Pi00q>  From the Twitter perspective, “Simply seeing an ad on Twitter yields positive results.” But Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/iGoW00BzPjL00A000Dq2A04> ’s <http://go.adexchanger.com/iGoW00BzPjL00A000Dq2A04>  Tim Peterson brought a dose of cynicism to Twitter’s endeavor: “The move is Twitter’s latest attempt to appease direct-response advertisers who are looking for tangible business outcomes from their ads and have been previously disappointed by Twitter’s ability to target those ads or track their performance.”

Yahoo’s X-Device?

Yahoo released a feature called Account Key that ties a user’s account to her mobile device. If that user needs to access that account on, say, a laptop, rather than typing in a password, she’ll get a push notification on her phone. Read more from  <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0o0P4qA02000WLg0D0AzDB> The Awl. Yahoo’s messaging around this feature is that it’s about security and ease of use. It’s easy to see that case. But as Facebook and Google confront the cross-device dilemma with their deterministic data sets, it’s hard not to wonder if Yahoo might leverage this feature to toss its hat into the ring. Here comes a new challenger?

Mobile app rewards, where users watch videos to advance to a new level or get tools, scored 54% in favorability and just 18% in negative reactions, making it the most preferred digital advertising format. Skippable pre-rolls (44% positive) and skippable mobile pop-ups (41%) were next on the list.

“One of our biggest challenges is that we’re in the bottom third of automotive advertisers, with a relatively small budget in comparison to our main competitors,” Kim Kyaw, Jaguar Land Rover North America’s manager of digital marketing, social media and CRM, said. “Mobile is a way for us to stand out in what’s become a cluttered marketplace in the TV environment.”

News Round Up

140-Character Connection

You thought Twitter and Google were tight before? The microblogging platform just brought on Google’s former chief business officer Omid Kordestani as its executive chairman. The last few weeks have been kind of crazy for Twitter. Co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as CEO, then the company unveiled its Moments product initiative. THEN it laid off more than 300 of its staffers. The New York Times speculates that Kordestani’s appointment “could bring a level of calm and stability.” Certainly, Kordestani brings extensive business connections from his time working at Google.

Message In A Bottle

Wired goes deep into Facebook’s plans for Messenger, its standalone app that has lately added commerce functionalities. The goal is to support Messenger with advertising, just like Facebook – and Alibaba. “When you're a business that generates most of its revenues from advertising, it's just a better business," Facebook VP of messaging David Marcus tells Wired. "eBay takes a cut of every transaction and listing; Alibaba does all that for free, and makes money from advertising.” Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPze4B00W000qAl0020AyD> on.

Want YouTube? YouSpend

YouTube is the future of prime-time entertainment. Well, that’s according to Google, of course. Also according to Google: If advertisers want to reach audiences on YouTube, they’re going to have to shell out. Addressing an audience of around 1,000 ad execs at its Brandcast event in London, Google’s UK’s managing director Eileen Naughton said the cost-per-reach when targeting 16-to-34-year-olds is “optimized when 24% of your budget is allocated to YouTube.” A quarter of spend? It’s a big ask. Read more in <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tz0Wl0P0z000DBf20L4qAA0>  The Drum.

Ad platform PulsePoint – recent recipient of $30 million in debt  <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DgA02000BWl0q4zALP0A> financing – has uncorked an RTB mobile marketplace. CEO Sloan Gaon claims PulsePoint can offer CPM rates equal to or higher than current desktop rates. The marketplace release and Gaon’s promise comes right after Pubmatic released its Quarterly Mobile Index <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0hlzWPB0A00>  showing that “mobile CPMs are higher and growing faster than desktop CPMs.” First it was the Year of Mobile (for like five years).

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0TzA009hD0AP00040> Been Choice’s Co-Founder On Ad Blocking, Privacy And What Went Down With Apple
"The idea is out there that, rather than breaking through ad-blocking technology, publishers and advertisers can just ask for consent. It’s as simple as that," said David Yoon, Been Choice co-founder

News Round Up

Making Hay

Condé Nast has millennials on the mind – at least that’s the message following its acquisition of Pitchfork Media, a niche music quarterly and website. Ravi Somaiya reports for The NYT that Condé Nast CDO Fred Santarpia (who led the deal) said Pitchfork brings an “audience of millennial males into our roster.” CEO Bob Sauerberg said the purchase reinforces the company’s “high-value millennial audiences.” Terms weren’t disclosed, though it’s clear where the value lies. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00l04L0iW00AD2q0zA04> .

Empty Nest

Twitter disclosed in an SEC filing <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00iA0L0D500zB2qW0AmP04>  that the company approved a “reduction in force plan of up to 336 employees.” Those layoffs represent approximately 8% of Twitter’s employee base, though Jack Dorsey said  <http://go.adexchanger.com/r4060A2i0BnLD0WzP00q0A0> that the engineering team will bear the brunt of the downsizing. In a letter to the company, Dorsey also said the new engineering force will be “a smaller and nimbler team.” (If they can’t get users on the platform, at least they won’t cost so much.) Related from Seeking Alpha: Do layoffs signal that Twitter is gunning for a sale <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PoB7D000qA2i04L0z> ?

Do Unto Others...

In the wake of a failed court case <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pzp00q280i>  against the Acceptable Ads Initiative at Adblock Plus (the name of its publisher whitelisting program), Axel Springer has turned its attention from its archenemy tech startup to actual readers. A new policy will block all content from Germany’s most popular news publisher to any readers with ad block software deployed, according to Bloomberg reporters. Axel Springer has other tricks up its sleeve, including investments in Blendle, a Dutch company that makes tech allowing publishers to charge micropayments per page view. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq09zA00qiD0AP00040> .

No Port In A Storm

“Pugnacious” Facebook is gearing up for a “cascade of privacy investigations in Europe,” reports The WSJ’s Sam Schechner. Should an expected ruling in Belgium go against it, the company has threatened to require Belgian users to submit to identity checks before accessing the service. With similar cases pending in Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Italy, the repercussions could be severe. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBr000Aiz0A200WL4qPa00> .

Facebook’s Inevitable YouTube Clone

What good are 5 billion daily video views if you can’t monetize them? Re/code’s Peter Kafka reports that Facebook is teeing up on a standalone video destination, à la YouTube. “If Facebook was going to really take on YouTube for video viewers’ time – and, eventually, advertisers’ dollars – then it would have to offer an experience … where you could go look for things you want.” From a revenue standpoint, pre-roll may be the real enticement here, as video in Facebook’s native scrolling environment is a tougher sell for advertisers and agencies. More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lib2sADP0z00A0> 

The Year Mobile Won

PubMatic released its new Quarterly Mobile Index <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000t2040qAzLPDBic0WA0> , which tracks trends across mobile ad channels. The news, evidently, is glowing all around. Mature markets like North America and Europe offer promising scale, while Latin America and Asia are bringing on new users at a shocking rate. Mobile web inventory is improving rapidly (though the bar was very low), and Apple app ads are the fastest-growing segment of any category for both price and volume.

Historically, marketing’s desire to protect data was driven by the need to ensure that competitors couldn’t get their hands on the crown jewels. In today’s digital world the threat is far more sinister and the potential repercussions far greater.

News Round Up

Facebook’s Online Mall

Facebook announced new features Monday <http://go.adexchanger.com/qzAW0A0DLw004d02B0Pk00q>  meant to get more people buying directly off its platform. TechCrunch reporter Anthony Ha takes a look at the upgrades and Facebook’s current suite of ecommerce engines (including buy buttons, product ads and a mobile feed for merchants to place their inventory). Now Facebook is hoping to bring its Instant Articles strategy to shopping, so users don’t skip out to the mobile web or desktop to convert on sales. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0ldzWPx0A00> .

CM-OMG

In a surprise move, MediaMath has brought on a CMO. The new exec: AdExchanger lead analyst Joanna O’Connell, who wrote, in a <http://go.adexchanger.com/GzB0Ad20Dy4mW0AL0000P0q>  company blog post, that “I am going to work with excited, enthusiastic people who are super smart.” A well-known equestrian, this will be O’Connell’s first stint at a technology company since 2010. The research world’s loss is MediaMath’s gain!

The Open Ocean

Open programmatic exchanges have known transparency and fraud issues. So why do marketers keep going back to the well? That’s the question asked by Mike Shields at The Wall Street Journal, who talks to Allstate and ad tech company Dstillery about their services-heavy partnership. It appears the solution so far has been bolting on additional fraud vendors (i.e., Integral Ad Science or White Ops). Additionally, the top exchange players are making major investments in data science teams focused on fraud. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00dn0ALAWPzzB02q000> .

Moments That Matter

Twitter’s new Moments feature, one of the company’s most-hyped product updates, is off to a rocky start. There’s been a backlash across media <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00dA0L0Do00zB2qW0AAP04>  circles <http://go.adexchanger.com/up0000DB4L0A0B02dPqWAz0>  regarding the annoying blue dot that plagues those who don’t check it. And more substantively, there are new editorial quagmires <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00qWqA000zPdA0C040D2L>  that accompany the product – like whether or not to show Justin Bieber naked (or how it monitors publisher partners that show Bieber naked). Others have registered complaints about Twitter stripping links from tweets in its curated feeds, which undercuts the publishers <http://go.adexchanger.com/ur0000DB4L0A0D02dPqWAz0>  supplying the original content <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PEB00000Ad4Dq02zWs0> .

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLaWk0APzt020qD40> Marketing Tech M&A Soars, Despite Stock Market And Venture Capital Angst
Much of the gloomy coverage is associated with an “arbitrary silliness about unicorns,” said Tolman Geffs, co-president of JEGI. He compared it to a classroom “where the cool kids get all the attention,” but most of the students are working with their heads down.

Quality, as measured by advertisers and expressed through bid prices, doesn't map to quality as measured by publishers or consumers.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWa4zA00yL0PB0p2> Spotify Wants To Focus On Big Brands, Outsources Geotargeted Ad Sales To Katz Radio Group
“Working on a 10-, 20-, 30-market buy for audio is probably two or three times more time-consuming than doing a cross-platform brand solution for a single brand,” said Les Hollander. “It’s a time-consuming part of our business, very labor intensive, so we are using some efficiencies in our resources by giving this off to Katz. They are an expert in this field.”

For Blue Apron, a subscription commerce site and meal delivery service, data helps refine the online experience but is less applied to offline investments. For Amazon-owned shoe and apparel e-tailer Zappos, data transcends ad placements and site personalization.

Vendors that want a shot need to demonstrate how they differ from the competition, share past successes, provide recommendations and explain exactly how they’ll improve ROI.

Making content that works well for both a user and an advertiser is more difficult than the industry is willing to admit. Today, we are papering over the problem with vanity metrics, but as a competitive landscape accelerates client understanding, eventually the tide will turn.

News Round Up

Silicon Valley Vs. Washington DC

The White House said it will no longer seek legislation or action forcing companies (i.e., Apple, Google and Microsoft) to open their encrypted user data to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The New York Times covered the reversal, which comes immediately after the EU high court nullified the Safe Harbor framework that US tech companies used to traffic data – on the grounds that the US government has illegal backdoor access to personal info. The White House’s 180 came down to technologists arguing that, if backdoor access exists for the US government, then it must exist for sophisticated external players as well. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/uv0000DB4L0A0E02aPqWAz0> .

Level Up

According to Ad Age, Zynga is offering a new in-game advertising product: sponsored levels. An early example is of Clorox promoting its Hidden Valley Ranch dressings through a FarmVille challenge in which users grew ingredients. The sponsored levels appear to be more like short mini-games within an app (instead of 30-second videos). Zynga VP Julie Shumaker said it’s good to have a variety of in-app advertising opportunities, as there’s immense pressure to make the games themselves free. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PFB00000Aa4Dq02zWw0> .

Who Needs Scale?

Digiday takes a look at The Boston Globe, following in the footsteps of media companies like Vox, Gawker and The Atlantic, which are “built around a constellation of highly focused sites.” Ricardo Bilton says the Globe will be launching Stat, a standalone site dedicated to medicine and life sciences, following the successful launch of Crux, which covers Catholic news. This move underscores a shift as publishers increasingly cater to engaged, niche audiences instead of competing simply on scale. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lax2GADP0z00A0> .

No In-App Ad Blocking

Although Apple allowed apps that kill ads in mobile Safari, it seems to have drawn the line with in-app ad blocking. Business Insider reports Apple is doing this because in-app ad blockers install root certificates, allowing them to see everything a user does online. So it’s a bit of a privacy issue. One of the affected apps, Been Choice, said it’s reworking its product to comply with Apple’s guidelines: “We will remove this capability to block ads in Facebook, Yahoo, Yahoo Finance, Google and Pinterest [Friday] and resubmit tomorrow morning for expedited approval. The ad- and tracker-blocking in other apps will not be impacted.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PHB00000Aa4Dq02zWy0> .

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q05WD0Lw000B4000zs> Quantcast Launches An Open Data Platform To Fuse Digital To TV And Offline Sales
“The key is getting people past age and sex demos to outcome-based measurement,” Frank Foster, SVP and GM of TiVo Research, said. “It makes no difference if you’re Macy’s and you’re hitting your target of 25-54 if you’re not selling more coats or shoes.”

"Programmatic TV is about finding your audience regardless of where they are. Now, we’ll buy a specific network because our audience is there, but with programmatic TV the idea is to find your audience regardless of network limitations," said Jay Eyunni, director of global digital media for Ancestry.

Toyota saw the partnership between NBCUniversal and AOL, in which NBC will syndicate premium content from network partners on AOL’s various properties, as a chance to tap into an integrated platform with premium content. It’s also an experiment to feel out the brave new world of online video.

News Round Up

Matters Of State

It may seem odd that despite the severe repercussions of the Safe Harbor case, few of the marketing and enterprise tech players most impacted have addressed the issue beyond formal statements. US companies don’t hesitate to throw their weight around on issues that affect them, but Europe is a live wire. In an email to AdExchanger, Epsilon Chief Privacy Officer and General Counsel Jeanette Fitzgerald elaborated on some options available to US business – such as getting clients to sign B2B agreements that simulate Safe Harbor’s standards. You’d expect businesses to holler for relief or clarification, but they’ll tiptoe and whisper despite the stakes because this is a minefield, and that means calling in the tanks. “We’re hopeful that [EU and US] negotiators will work expeditiously to correct this situation,” said Fitzgerald.

Digital Media Still Undervalued

AOL’s Tim Armstrong thinks spiking digital media valuations for the likes of Business Insider still aren’t high enough. In a Bloomberg Business interview he says, “Ten years from now, people are going to say the biggest missed opportunity was everyone ran away from content during that time period and five to six companies went into content. There’s an amazing amount of benefit to having invested during that period of time.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DW54zA00EL0PB0A2> Watch the whole thing.

Pay Per View

The Dutch startup Blendle, which lets publishers offer micropayments for article views, picked up some high-profile US backers – NYT, WSJ and WaPo – as it looks to expand internationally, according to a report from Emma Hall at Ad Age. Could this be the bridge for publishers between subscriptions and advertising revenue that publishers need? More <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0zFA0q0B0BAL0PD52> .

Twitter Amplify 2.0

It’s Twitter Amplify for the everyman. Two years after rolling out the TV audience <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00CWqA000zP5A0G040D2L>  extension program to a handful of broadcasters, Twitter revealed a beta expansion to Amplify that will allow more creators and publishers to monetize their video content based on a rev-share with a 70 (creator)/30 (Twitter) split. Twitter’s trimming a few layers of workflow in Amplify as well, since advertisers can now pre-select categories of content they want their message to run against and dynamically populate their pre-roll into targeted video content within the Amplify network, sans any lengthy individual publisher agreements. Faster time to…video! The blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0DH02q0L0AB0Dz00A54> .

Square could help close the loop for Twitter, proving the efficacy of Twitter as an advertising channel. A user sees a targeted ad on Twitter, that user makes an in-store purchase and the loop is closed via tracking pixel.

News Round Up

On Target

Ad Age’s Alexandra Bruell catches up with Target’s SVP of media and measurement, Kristi Argyilan, who was poached from IPG Mediabrands to build out the retailer’s programmatic strategy. Argyilan seems to be enjoying the first-party data she now has at her disposal, saying it’s the driver behind a host of programmatic initiatives such as experimental video and TV. Also notable: She says Target often looks for point solutions and the opportunity to expand internal capabilities through licensing tech. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PwB00000A24Dq02zWv0> .

ONE More Walled Garden

By the end of 2015 AOL will have assimilated Verizon’s and Microsoft’s first-party consumer data. Garett Sloane writes for Digiday that this new triumvirate provides a data foundation that “could be a viable third option behind Facebook and Google in terms of reach and targeting.” Verizon’s on-hand credit card numbers (and access to FiOS TV) give a massive leg up. But contrary to AOL’s longtime positioning as the open alternative to Facebook and Google, Verizon now looks a little more walled garden-ish itself. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBx000A2z0A200WL4qPw00> .

“Extra! Extra!”

The New York Times has stood out in the past half decade as the legacy publisher blazing a digital trail, just as BuzzFeed is the bellwether for new media companies. Steven Perlberg reports for WSJ that the Times is shooting for $800 million in digital revenue in 2020 (which is double its 2014 online haul). Perlberg teases out the rocky path forward for the Times, which needs to have subscription services worth paying for without sacrificing free content. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/GzB0A220Dy4xW0AL0000P0q> .

Getting Out Of The Stream

Pandora spent $450 million to buy Ticketfly, which works with concerts on ticket sales, marketing and in-venue revenue. The deal’s most obvious driver is the ability to direct users to contextually relevant concerts, but from the other side the deal gives Pandora advertisers new platforms to reach listeners. It’s a smart move, says Matt Burns at TechCrunch, since streaming radio is low-margin but ticket sales are very lucrative. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWy400z0ABD0020zL02P0Aq> .

News Round Up

Amazon’s Search Dominance

Amazon is pulling away from competitors as the go-to source for product info, according to recent research from BloomReach. Jason Del Rey of Re/code reports 44% of 2,000 respondents said they go directly to Amazon when researching products, compared to 21% for other retail brands and 34% for Google and other search tools. The Amazon intent data trove: large and getting larger. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/uA0000DB4L0A0x02ZPqWAy0> .

‘Moments’ Are Trending

Twitter’s been teasing its “Project Lighting” product initiative for the better part of a year. On Tuesday, the day after Dorsey Day, the curtain rose on “Moments,” a new tab in the interface that curates and streamlines content on specific topics, events or live news. “This is a product aimed at people who maybe have given up on Twitter,” PM Madhu Muthukumar tells BuzzFeed. There could be a paid media opportunity here around sponsorship of buzzy cultural phenomenon, a la the “Promoted Trends” of yesteryear. Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0BZyWPy0A00> .

F Is For Facebook

Facebook will begin grading app publishers based on performance against metrics like downloads or product sales, a move the social media giant is calling Advertiser Outcome Scores. Tim Peterson points out for Ad Age that it’s data Facebook has long had internally but is now making available so app publishers can evaluate what’s working. The overall goal is to optimize toward substantive results (downloads and user engagements) and away from the click-hungry app download links that ruin many a user’s mobile experience.

Destination Nowhere

Ryanair is coming to Google with a complaint that’s typical of major brands in the travel and hospitality industry: Third-party, site-scraping vendors are hijacking their SEO value. The Drum’s John McCarthy shows that a search for “Ryanair flights,” for instance, could lead a user to a shady company that games its URL to appear to have a partnership with the airline. Tough to claim the user was looking for a Ryanair lookalike on a search term like that. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0DA02q0L0AB0Dy00AZ4> .

"Real-time brand safety layers would likely reduce barriers to entry for incentive marketers, especially those conservative brands slow to jump on the social media bandwagon," said Gila Wilensky, director of search and biddable, Essence.

Search And Pintent

New merchants and platforms are selling on the Pinterest site and app – including Bloomingdale’s, Wayfair and Shopify. Pinterest commerce chief Michael Yamartino writes in a blog post that Pinterest users who convert on shoppable pins are often new to the brand or retailer.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBX000AVy0A200WL4qP400> Read it. Adweek’s Lauren Johnson follows up with Yamartino, who says he sees Pinterest as a discovery service more than a social platform. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/yyVWDqP00A0LAB504Y00020> .

Gray Lady #HumbleBrag

Dean Basquiat, executive editor at The New York Times, pens a note to readers <http://go.adexchanger.com/iZVW00ByP6L00A000Dq2A04>  about the company’s 1 million digital-only subscribers. “We still employ as many reporters as we did 15 years ago – and our ranks now include graphics editors, developers, video journalists and other digital innovators who are making our digital offerings ever richer. … They are not deskbound aggregators, either.” Reality check: The Awl says it’s layoff season <http://go.adexchanger.com/o0270000V00yPW04DABAqL0>  in media circles.

If At First You Don’t Succeed

The Ad Age staff looks back at Ad Week and sees an industry that is torn in half by ad blocking and fraud, with technology as the solution on one side, and creativity and transparency on the other. Considering the surfeit of “solutions” that are hitting the market – disable content for ad-block users, shift to native, cut back on tech vendors, refocus on creative, etc. – it’s clear the next few years will be marked more by trial and error than clean-cut best practices. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW01L0000VP02BAqDy0840A> .

And Yet…

While many view native advertising as a solution to ad blocking, it’s not immune to ad-block software. The Journal’s Mike Shields distinguishes between sites like BuzzFeed and Forbes, which produce sponsored content for their own channels, and tech vendors that automate across scores or hundreds of feed-style sites. For the native programmatic networks, there are still snippets of code that blockers can identify. Shields takes a cross-section of leaders in the emerging space and asks what their publishing partners are most concerned about. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0V0P4qA02000WL9020AyDB> .

News Round Up

Sweating Out The Fever

For anyone who recently emerged from hibernation, ad blocking has sent digital media into an existential tailspin. But in an interview with The Wall Street Journal’s Amir Mizroch, Criteo COO Erich Eichman says the ad tech bellwether is “yet to see an impact on its (operating) numbers.” Eichman believes the industry is more insulated than many suppose, since publishers and consumers would push back against the loss of free content. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LMI2sADP0y00A0> .

Just Say No?

A few publishers are kicking ad tech middlemen to the curb, Mike Shields reports for The Wall Street Journal. Mic.com founder Chris Altchek tells him, “We looked at what ad tech looked like three years ago or so, and we saw that the experience was bad for users and didn’t look like it worked well for advertisers anyway. … Even if you do it and did it really well, you still don’t make a lot of money.” The problem here is deciding what to include and not to include in the “ad tech” bucket. Ad servers? Programmatic direct deals?  <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqtB0y2LW004D0P0AAJ0M00> Read it.  

Baby Bundles

It’s easy to see the disintegration of linear subscription TV as a slow-moving, inevitable process, like the melting of a glacier. But a pair of New York Times reporters dig into the data with Nielsen’s SVP of audience insights, Glenn Enoch, and see an interesting shift among millennials as the generation matures. Young millennials are the most likely demo to have cut the cord, but those with families (primarily low to mid 30s) are 80% cable subscribers, with an additional 14% using an antenna (often citing concerns over child-friendly programming). There are other variables skewing those numbers, but it’s a potentially consequential trend for overall ad budgets. Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/FyDBL00Ku0W0P2Mq000AA04> it.

The Revenue Doesn’t Disappear

Snapchat has kicked its marketing capabilities into high gear over the past few months, with high-profile deals in politics <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PvB00000AM4Dq02yWL0> , live events <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0MA0DB0WM2Lq00yA00w4P0>  and media <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40N0A2M0BxLD0WyP00q0A0>  (oh, and Truffle Pig <http://go.adexchanger.com/GyB0AM20Dy4OW0AL0000P0q> ). Now Hannah Kuchler of the Financial Times reports on the messaging app’s new sponsored lens product (so users could, say, automatically insert a branded object such as a Marvel superhero outfit). For upcoming Halloween, Thanksgiving or Black Friday, Snapchat is asking $750,000 per day. On an “off-peak day” it’s a meager $450,000. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/AM0z04WB200AyPq00L0P0DA> .

Disappearing Act

A mystery buyer purchased browser extension Adblock (not to be mistaken with Adblock Plus, the world’s most installed blocker). The terms and reasoning behind the deal remain unknown, according to Owen Williams at The Next Web. The app has been sustained to date by gifts and donations raised by founder Michael Gundlach (who no longer runs the company – another topic nobody in the matter is willing to discuss). The company relies on Adblock Plus’ Acceptable Ads initiative, which is yet another reason why the sale is perplexing. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0MA0DB0WQ2Lq00yA00A4P0> .

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02y000dH00yPW04DABAqL0> Are Direct Buys The Only Way To Keep The Industry Fraud Free?
“It’s striking that almost a year after the original study that the ANA did, there is not a smidgen less [fraud] and maybe there’s even more coming up,” Michael Zimbalist said. “That should be a real call to arms for all of us.

Bad data from ad fraud could cloud or create a false picture of a customer’s cross-channel journey and lead organizations to erroneous conclusions and poor decisioning.

I understand that viewability is a major issue both for desktop and mobile, but to hold back large budgets while waiting for MRC’s standard to be established seems overly cautious and potentially detrimental to long-term marketing goals.

News Round Up

Immobile

The New York Times takes a look at mobile web latency across 50 mobile sites, and the resulting charticle provides a scathing commentary on ad load times. The story singles out Boston.com (a NYT property until 2013), which the story’s authors say requires 30 seconds to deliver ad content on its home page and costs users about 30 cents per page load in data usage. At the other end of the spectrum is The Guardian, which doesn’t have the fastest page load, but has the least ad tech and is the most resilient against ad blocking. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DyBqA0020P0WJAHo00> .

Go Measure Yourself

Publishers, tech companies and agencies have pushed the agnostic measurement firms to consolidate or rationalize their differences. (It’s hard to optimize when measurement results are divergent.) No surprise then that, following news of comScore’s acquisition of Rentrak, the tension with Nielsen has heightened, according to Steven Perlberg at The Wall Street Journal. Perlberg documents some barbed comments from Nielsen President Steve Hasker and the CEOs of both Rentrak and comScore, who all sat on the same Ad Week panel. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPyK4B00W000qAH0020ApD> .

Breaking The Movie Trailer

Netflix is gung-ho on sequential creative in its programmatic media buys, as reported by Jennifer Faull of The Drum. “A typical movie trailer has a three-act arc: Introduce the story, bring in an element of danger and then the conclusion,” CMO Kelly Bennett told an Advertising Week audience. “Instead of trying to do that in two minutes and thirty seconds how do we split it up into five, 10 and 15 seconds [of video]? How do we combine that 10-second Instagram moment with a 20-second TrueView?” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00HA0L0DL00yB2qW0AqP04> .

Why Fraud Persists

In a LinkedIn post, former AppNexus CTO Mike Nolet explores the perverse incentives supporting online ad fraud. He takes the example of MichaelGolf.com, an English-language website with scraped content that Google AdEx lists as the top source of video ad supply. Google prevented advertisers from paying for this ne’er-do-well’s property’s impressions, but it’s likely some money got through anyway. “There is no downside in trying,” he writes. “Law enforcement doesn't do anything here so nobody is going to jail. What happens is that fraudsters just keep trying and trying and eventually make money. The only question is how much.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBr000AHy0A200WL4qPM00> Read it.

In part to address the lack of traditional industry input, ABP announced Tuesday that it would create an independent board of developers, publishers and advertisers to oversee the Acceptable Ads program.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBm000ACy0A200WL4qPM00> NBCU’s Yaccarino: ‘We Couldn’t Wait For Nielsen Any Longer’
“One day I hope to wake up and Nielsen will actually be able to measure cross-platform viewership, but today we can’t do it – and I can’t help our marketing customers as much as I would like to,” Linda Yaccarino said.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0y0NWD0L4Pn0A2q0C0BA00> The Sell Sider Column...What Publishers Are Talking About At Advertising Week by John Trimble, Pandora
There’s been some buzz around publishers only selling inventory that is 100% viewable, but it won’t be long before viewability guarantees are a requirement, as opposed to a headline.

News Round Up

Stay In Your Lane

The Thrillist and JackThreads combo was one of the first to merge editorial and commerce. Now it’s goodbye to all that, as the two companies make arrangements to split up and raise funds ($54 million combined), Re/code’s Jason Del Rey reports. Among Thrillist’s investors is Axel Springer, the acquisitive German publisher who just bought Business Insider. We’ll see if the many editorial outlets that followed Thrillist into the commerce biz hit the same wall. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0ypA0q0P0BAL0PDC2> .

Getting Smart On Smartphones

Ad Age’s Kate Kaye catches up with David Katz, who runs Hearst’s programmatic solutions. Asked what is the most important technology Hearst has developed to improve its ad offering, Katz says, “Cross-device targeting and analytics. ... It's important to discuss all devices from an attribution perspective on the same user.” Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPyQ4B00W000qAC0020AqD> on.

Pandora’s Set-Top Box

Gerry Smith reports for Bloomberg that the “broad demographics” of TV audiences – long considered superior for brand advertising – are losing out to the “surgical” strikes of digital. But while digital tech has worked hard to achieve TV’s scale and market, TV is only now figuring out it has targeting capabilities of its own. What’s more, to address viewability and internet quality concerns, ad tech has developed tools to measure viewership (Did the user scroll past autoplay? How many pixels were in view?), but TV is just now discovering it should know the same about commercials. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/AC0r04WB200AyPq00L0R0DA> .

The Mobile Epoch

Facebook may have a billion users per day and a market cap around $245 billion, but according to Ben Thompson of Stratechery, now might be the time buy low on the advertising giant. Thompson tracks three tech epochs: Microsoft’s PC dominance, Google’s Internet dominance and now Facebook’s time in the mobile age. It isn’t just the fundamentals of mobile usership driving Facebook up (though Microsoft’s “computer in every home and office” looks quaint compared to mobile’s ubiquity). The platform also benefits more than Google (a search/DR specialist) from the shift in brand advertising dollars from TV to digital. Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ts0WC0P0y000DBS20L4qAA0> .

Native RTB

Programmatic native – it’s a thing. Sharethrough is hooking up with AppNexus to make native ads available programmatically. Native advertising has been floated – most recently by Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer <http://go.adexchanger.com/yyCWDqP00A0LABT04t00020>  – as a potential antidote to ad blocking. But scale has been an issue. "If you're Ford and you want to buy car ads all over the Web, you're not going to create custom ad units for every individual publisher out there that has their own native unit,” Pat McCarthy, SVP of marketing at AppNexus, told <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0Uu02q0L0AB0Dy00AC4>  Adweek. Sharethrough’s clients include Forbes, People, Men’s Health and USA Today Sports.

Social Pub Adds Data Smarts

Audience Partners CEO Dave Helmreich has jumped to "social-first" news publisher Independent Journal (IJ.com), where he'll be COO. Helmreich was previously at data management companies Targus and Neustar. "With over 30 million monthly unique users and having only been founded three years ago, we have a great team and a ton of opportunity ahead of us," he tells AdExchanger.
