Internet Trends


In spite of the fact that former Morgan Stanley analyst has joined the VC world (Kleiner Perkins), she is still cranking out her famous Internet Trends report which she presented at All Things D's D10 conference. And guess what? Mobile is still coming! Mobile phone versus smartphone users appears to be a key metric as mobile phone (no "smartness" or Web) outnumbers its smarter cousin by 6 billion users to 1 billion users worldwide. See the prez now. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001z7MNxyKIcNMMc2WwF3OzzYXcnki5mHJ0aqG-PtOBeDIis9yAOdriI12-FRI9bGm_dTKgyjUFbaQ4zAPo6-N93bb3u5imTcAenZ_NCeiAMh1YJIaraxu2FR4N_4jETZlLvIoMI4BBs81PoNdIm30WmA==>  She cautions that mobile ad CPMs are looking to be only 20% of PC display CPMs. That's what happens with a lack of targeting options.   But, she sees blue skies ahead... "real-time" is just getting started. 


Battling The Showroom


Samsung and Sony appear to be coming to the rescue of brick-and-mortar retailers who are tired of being picked clean by in-store shoppers who are trying and then buying online - known as "showrooming <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001z7MNxyKIcNOJs5LVO9oTiW0vtxWKY8UDBDfIUilZTvC9vRFD7KJkJLdqT5jjI15OtXre7uBWZ3VjVTiQbiW600VtX3gELiNs0qdOsmIioeXEojfVANYZWoS-Jj3HayBUoc2MOjguNxiuLpGCBlKf6DOMk7OTmzYNBCshpWLQ8gw=> ".

If not, it would seem other manufacturers - who are not will to toe the pricing line - will under cut them in the long run. 


On Microsoft Acquiring


Is this the future for real-time ad platform AppNexus? The New York Times explores Microsoft's acquisition of Skype which it continues to keep as a separate entity rather than integrate it more fully into the mothership. Skype's former CEO, and now President once Microsoft acquired the company, says, "We've kept our identity and our autonomy." Given the post-acquisition challenges of Avenue A and AdECN, maybe Microsoft has found a new roadmap for successful purchases. With its significant investment in AppNexus, which is rumored to give Microsoft 'first look' before any deal can be consummated, an acquisition seems inevitable. The NY Times' Nick Wingfield explains, "The distance has helped Skype stay true to its mission of allowing people to make calls from practically any device connected to the Internet, not just the ones powered by Microsoft software."

Social CRM and the Starship Enterprise 


The mother ship has landed, but are the natives friendly? Moves by Oracle and Salesforce.com to buy Vitrue and Buddy Media, respectively, could bring social CRM into the cloud in a big way, says Deep Focus CEO Ian Schafer on AdAge's DigitalNext blog. But obstacles remain. Among them: agencies still control budgets, there's little precedent for cross-channel CRM, and Salesforce hasn't proven itself as a B2C marketer. The stakes are galactic. " If, via these acquisitions, Buddy Media (and Vitrue, for that matter) can further evolve marketing suites to encapsulate a longer-term focus on acquisition, conversion, retention, advocacy, and lifetime value, while somehow liberating data from its platform confines, then we may finally see social media live up to its promise."

Gee-Whiz Geo


James Moore <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001z7MNxyKIcNMAZW6rIKeVeB7G40UFS7tN7u-sRo16gfLDJANbcGbFQB-BA21GAe5We1LdLxqPPDE82vYlnh7ntDAbyd2TbpcW0SXs3fGtdrJjBwjNL-P1QfXU7VdWyHr0fGeNv5j_-z0=> , writing for Marketing Land, sees a knowledge gap in how marketers apply geo-targeting today. He suggests ad buyers take a page from politicians and the research industry, which have overcome the natural limitations of IP and zip code targeting by following shifts in IP assignments over time - a process sometimes called "beyond location." To wit: "The history of IP deployment is then used to predict the likelihood, or bias, that an IP qualifies some condition or property denoted as the desired target." The result: ad buyers can build more compelling geo-segments, for example isolating areas with a high index of good home equity.

Do Not Fear DCO


"Dynamic Creative Optimization" - the ability tailor a display ad's creative in real-time - is sometimes viewed as never-ending agony for designers and project managers. PointRoll, the Gannett-owned rich media provider, has a blog post <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001z7MNxyKIcNNAjutw4OPyNWR-XBujH2zKpLsXhuLasnnuwABFqZtDN9IkKVwpWi-Mare_jgP5vbaXz1fToWHMGDr2j8ihL087-hsQmHNoa_9_9zBguF6T-3pO6gDaG1FM1fncWioQ8c4LHTF9bMfIWHevBaVDZnKhf3_6c435b5B8KR-RX7hhUhE2o7wah1uV>  promoting its OnPoint platform as the solution to all the worries. The OnPoint system claims to let designers store all their dynamic content on the system and make the process of tweaking ads a little less painless. 


Self-Reg Effort Looks Past Cookies


The Better Business Bureau has lightly wrapped the knuckles of a few ad companies - including BlueCava, Turn, and DataXu - for minor privacy infractions. ClickZ's Kate Kaye notes the BBB released the company names as part of its role in the Digital Advertising Alliance's self-reg initiative. The key nugget here: the DAA has its eye on device fingerprinting. "BlueCava's situation is especially interesting because it suggests the BBB's approach to monitoring behavioral ad companies for compliance with the self-reg program is not focused on cookies alone - but all technologies enabling data collection and tracking."

Groupon Adding New Product


It would seem that Groupon has ample opportunity to cull its vast local ad datasets from daily deals and roll out a more robust ad business. But, maybe that's just me. The Wall Street Journal reports that Groupon is venturing deeper into local through the payment process. The WSJ's Rolfe Winkler writes, "Today, merchants face fees ranging as high as 5% per transaction when customers use various cards. And they must rent expensive processing equipment. For a few dozen early testers of its payments platform, Groupon is giving away a modified iPod Touch to process transactions and, more important, charging merchants as little as 1.8%."

Oh and Groupon acquired a local restaurant, point-of-sale (POS) app maker called Breadcrumb yesterday.

Salesforce Has A New Buddy?


Social marketing software is the new DSP. Last week Vitrue was acquired by Oracle. This week, Peter Kafka says on All Things D that Buddy Media and its $90 million of venture funding is about to get rolled up into Salesforce.com for $800 million+. (Kudos to Optim.al's Rob Leathern for pretty much predicting it on AdExchanger last week <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001BPyPB3-K8caajXi7PSVXyp6z3WJ61CLPxZ2aLO13xYEVYXX8KgaLS2x5q_YTyKFqWHOCc839eHGwBvuMzha1S1DccMdMSRezpohzXXdau_hR3yRSI53u51vwNAaeiD7gtT4_canJBEPm8POMnNrMxCkmJcByk2u-YgqOOfmbB7OpmmIQI9lk8GqMjKq7kf8C> .) Kafka explains, "... it appears that Salesforce intends to use Buddy Media to extend its core customer relationship management offering. The presumable logic: Acquiring Buddy Media will help Salesforce's clients reach their customers and leads where they are spending lots of online time..."

If true, and extending CRM functionality is a focus, are B2B marketing software companies like Marketo, Hubspot or Eloqua next? Facebook's perceived IPO challenges might be playing into acquisitions right now, too. Also, check out this interview with AdExchanger in February <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001BPyPB3-K8caRnzpYDA5hv596NQpYbOhrvVPNZZ751BYJzGcQL5o11i8vivaGsoAr191-PKR4o0qjopTB36G8lfvoTKytU0WlYd1aNpgkfgweQHtsNUkGYVI_c3sh3_3p-GpS-9cBnj-RAk_eCtOaftJxLGuGMTdVIXE5smSPSjOSmkSo_Xn_dw==>  with Buddy Media CEO Mike Lazerow about the reasons behind his company's purchase of social ads firm Brighter Option: "From our perspective, we are making a bet that advertising is moving from the front end of the campaign, where you're trying to get people to do stuff they don't want to do for the most part - usually in places they don't want to do it - to the middle and end of the campaign, meaning you put out content through all the channels you already own, and then you figure out what people are telling you with their comments, clicks, likes, tweets and retweets and everything else." Salesforce may be getting into ads.


Targeting The UDID


Mobile app promotion platform Fiksu said that the mothballing of the UDID <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001BPyPB3-K8cagSyBIv4Cf2ZXXDGVoGDeWiB7-e5HoLRpKcYPqq5z8uSipDEzy1Jln-iAuLZovKJWeMqfivKn8DfsAVbL7im9fGL4ZhyHDwp5ubKQ5CWPcx4iXnkoSuGa3Is216AU-pNxgW10Q6T0-v6qH4k5bxmv2m3AthK4qcLk=>  by Apple is having its effect as free iPhone app downloads decreased in the month of April by 5% according to the company's statistics. Presumably, developers who had been using the UDID for targeting are either moving to other platforms or looking for other non-UDID solutions which enable targeting.

Yahoo! 'Premium' Display


Macquarie Securities has been busy refreshing the Yahoo! home page for the past few months and, according to Macquarie's first-half 2012 data as reported in MediaPost, "Sales of oversized and custom ad units on Yahoo's main page rose slightly on a sequential basis, but were up substantially year-over-year."

Regarding its latest data, Macquarie cautions that it's hard to tell if premium display rates are being cut to improve Yahoo! home page sell-through. 


Porn Isn't The Prob


In Adweek, editor Mike Shields explores bad content and how it plays a part in advertising strategies whether some advertisers know it or not. We're not talking about porn here, this is plain 'ol bad content. Shields explains, "To be sure, these sites don't seem to attract heavy user engagement. So why the surge in traffic? Media buyers suspect these companies are somehow paying for clicks or duping lost searchers. Still, they can command a decent premium via SSPs, since they can be easily labeled as delivering valued audiences such as auto buyers. Meanwhile, the content-since it's not racy, merely lousy-doesn't raise alarms with verification software from companies such as DoubleVerify."

Getting The Bad Out Of Ads


In an Official Google blog post titled "The fight against scam ads-by the numbers," David Baker, Director of Engineering, Advertising, says that his company has cut the amount of "bad ads" - think malware or anything against Google's TOS - by 50%. Interestingly, humans, not tech, are the key as Baker explains, "One method we use to test the success of our efforts is to ask human raters to tell us how we're doing. These human raters review a set of sites that are advertised on Google. )...) By using human raters, we can calibrate our automated systems and ensure that we're improving our efforts over time."

Network TV Dead By 2020


MediaPost's Bob Garfield follows up a prediction he says he made in 2005 to say things are on track and network TV should be out of business by 2020. He even shares some helpful stats, "Back in 2005, the major networks' audience had been shrinking for a decade to a mere 16.5% of TV households in prime time. That's for all five of the nets put together. Seven years later the aggregate rating is down to an optimistic 13.5% -- optimistic because that number includes DVR time-shifters, who skip past commercials. For advertisers, those viewers may as well not exist. Removing them from the ratings, only 11.5% of households are watching network shows live in prime time. The other 88.5% are doing something else."

Kicking Tires


With reports continuing to swirl of Amazon building a significant display advertising business, Kunur Patel says in Ad Age that the acquisition of a mobile ad network may be next. Patel thinks Amazon's ecommerce data could be a powerful bottom-of-the-funnel solution for ads. Hells yeah. She writes, "Amazon also owns massive mobile traffic. About half of all U.S. adult smartphone subscribers visited Amazon sites and apps in March, according to ComScore. That makes Amazon the fourth-most-visited property on smartphones." Mobile ad network Jumptap is rumored to be among the acquisition candidates.

Mobile Private Marketplace


On Friday, mobile ad serving company MoPub said it would begin offering private marketplace (or exchange!) technology to clients. MoPub CEO Jim Payne tells TechCrunch's Anthony Ha that "the private market is similar to marketplaces for desktop ad impressions, but it's dealing with the specific data points that are interesting to mobile advertisers, like latitude/longitude coordinates."

Facebook Device Data


On The NY Times Bits blog, writer Nick Bilton sees an ad-supported Facebook phone on the horizon. Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi sees Facebook going after the lower-priced phone market competing against Google's Android phone, not the Apple iPhone. Milanesi adds that "at a mass market level, both companies could take the same approach as Amazon, offering low-cost hardware, like the Kindle, and subsidizing some of the costs through advertising." Read more <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001QipAZ2mntIT4FkCKSGLz24TixfUY2uI0LLqMynGjvIiKYHyh05rj7M5PnPbFliQC_zrG9PLyLfxcxCkOHZbXCs--wugNZSHLcgsa6BxGAoikjj-UUdtWM0xdAQ0othxS0erTRJoWZtjo45dYFjOQ91szHVozbafsn4nmBa3hPZXeNWnBxGg6dU8AXbUoVTzf_0G2fKV7T58=> . If Google or Facebook can "own" the device, they get better (first-party) data for targeting. With a thoughtful opt-in, users could provide personally-identifiable info in exchange for a free phone. For now, Apple appears to have a strong hold on an attractive, higher-income audience (that is willing to pay top dollar for phones and plans). The company could play the free, ad-supported phone game, of course. But, Apple may not care as it's on the verge of the connected trifecta where computer, phone and TV merge in the cloud. Read the rumor on Apple Insider <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001QipAZ2mntITV3L4bVZDVFfuJtXVUyKU_dMXMldMu5SDd6xCNt_BWaajl6VYCukl6CPqPaps_Ni33C_camzLOEtLqmN6lG6T0-EN5vyuXZ_GSQEMtKfNr0DITa8_fL8W8c-4muslz8f5FaalfWsA7ltJyOj0qcFlEj-p5c1bDlxd0zGa8tt1kx65XJ8ssbH7MRwPpD-DZeMgf3SR_8cPAtVD-mHy7h-jsK1w0RCqtlM4hcA9ATeSefA==> .


Levinsohn's Plan


The Business Insider says it has its fingers on interim CEO Ross Levinsohn's plan for Yahoo!: "Medium Term: Calm Everyone Down, Sell Stuff, Hoard Cash" and "Long Term: Find A Way To Re-Engage Users." There's a lot more explanation here. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001QipAZ2mntITUdoElCFkbahPotv6ruDb4j9CWIjdktqF0HMXc8oPEzlJ6gCy86fwnvQhbJr2AjdETvxYEBYqKC8HNKWa1GdJk_LaZ3_UcglSP7IEWPvRgxt_FowewIZzeEZKQsohdG0pJ4A4FfUMYDUT-TZOy1vD9bbFA1k1MLbO99YvyQCl3M3i5jHEnx6KD99OzoCv9aQI=>  TBI's Nicholas Carlson adds, "We understand he will invest most heavily in Yahoo Sports and Yahoo Finance, with an eye toward video content, which garners much higher ad rates than text-based content." Yahoo! needs to target lean-back, longer form video, not just video. An effective strategy could be transformational for Yahoo! as it looks to capture TV dollars. 


Display Myths


In a round up of industry reaction, Digiday's Brian Morrissey asks industry execs what's the biggest myth of online display advertising. Say Media president Troy Young says, "The biggest myth is this: 'The problem is the banner.' The problem is not the banner. It's two other things. It's the relationship between the banner and the rest of the content on the page. Faced with low yields and CPM pricing, publishers have littered pages with banners that no one sees."

Social Commerce Buys Data


Design etailer Fab.com is featured in an article in The New York Times and online marketing data is front and center. This time - it's social signal data specifically as Fab.com's CEO Jason Goldberg discusses yield strategy, "On typical e-commerce sites, every single piece of real estate is calculated to measure the return on investment of each pixel. But social media marketing needs to be measured differently than traditional marketing. We need different ways to measure sharing."

Clickin' Mobile Ads


On Adotas, reporter Brian LaRue covers a new survey from mobile ad serving and network company Mojiva. A question asks what experience consumers want after clicking a mobile ad. Novel! The multiple choice answers: "57 percent said they would be inclined to browse a website or play a game, 44 percent said they'd listen to music, 43 percent said they'd download an app, 38 percent said they'd request more information, 36 percent said they'd watch a video, 35 percent said they'd redeem or download a coupon, 24 percent said they'd make a purchase, and 12 percent said they'd tap to call."

Mobile RTB


On eConsultancy, Right Media's EMEA director Sue Hunt says that mobile advertising is picking up speed, but doesn't quite say how real-time biddable it is during an interview. Hunt answers, "As we release new mobile targeting capabilities this month - giving us the ability to target devices (smartphones and tablets), browser, operating system, connection and carrier - we expect to see an increase in demand for mobile advertising. We already have many supply partners keen to trade mobile inventory through the Right Media exchange." Perhaps the EU privacy directive has people ducking for cover.

Was MSNBC.com, Now NBC.com?


It's long been a source of speculation about whether NBC Universal would take full control of MSNBC.com from its partner in the website venture, Microsoft. Adweek's Mike Shields <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001LSKkgf-pEPQxNVBcrxTc4FRBJAMwgXzWCDa6lKq0UXgoKMm_gwme6FO0hSArZDlGlOGufskaGu1fjSIeZ8DTqbMnzKClY98NU95gp6GWudhyY5K1xt2yPEHJZa8kipAEENng_QRKE2xbsYrbuQboRxKsUpE3-Ro05TrR46don73LeLXxLVBM2upfu-3jnb1V>  hears that the Comcast-owned network is considering it. "The site benefits heavily from its prominent placement on the MSN portal, and that's something NBCU will be hesitant to give up," says Shields, though a new content sharing deal could probably be arranged. 


Facebook Shares More Data


Facebook is giving developers better means to track shares, clicks and other interactions with their apps. In the past, the Insights reporting tool "has not indicated how many individual users performed the above actions, meaning that the numbers would have looked the same if one user published 20 stories, or if 20 users each published one story," notes a Facebook blog post <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001LSKkgf-pEPQPy4oEUgAbSVnp0PSZbuuLjKe0UA-OaZSyNtQTbBj0P6F7tt-idH-wQ30pEotddsnwxh2GBVghFo9hp4Hpxvr-FD8NluMZp7YMaugKtHTWao7nnyZVXuDMigoZvqSTjJorv1baYUEZ3X5rYubigyxXuGF936cLuHPo-vqQFLTY80kKCpX8EbV045ewyPScdpI-jja0dTHCaw==> . Now they can. TheNextWeb adds <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001LSKkgf-pEPSpInoebuq72RzejH8c_iFrtTnhlzsaEY-S2C5yAuR169ouAF-54X5DF73mA4c8JHG9yU3n0oBGhXRNrdhMcjkkaaUjL19bEIB4FTK2Y5N0op6nRq5R9FTrLmgZo1_Emc_O0nCEJqS4-lmKgRyE8Vu9vdqfDAxcRwCFUzP2pAh9DW4bZnscPRhAWkaeHMKHaTithVkHq_jNU0Ja2qtva3dNxvHjePYmSSyF7sQNJyZsDpLreyHpo5h8KFIMRkPWRnQ=>  the impact could help low-performing apps especially. "Developers will now see how many unique users have seen and accepted their Facebook authorization dialog. This type of information can help a company figure out why their app isn't converting to actual new users." 


Display-ing Tweets


Betabeat's Jessica Roy gets a little breathless about geo-targeter LocalResponse's <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001LSKkgf-pEPRyqaLstZiedEVcoCEARBcRCcOkU8o-OJeBsGYrWZIIjptahp5Chka0JLWFHSF9bWPA-ihc0BFK4rtO1_BLg0xHPJsVavE6haQN7XlHSQlUag==>  tracking users' tweets as a basis for showing them related display ads. Roy notes, "This is great news for advertisers, who have long struggled with the best way to reach their most likely customers, as well as content producers who can charge a higher premium for better targeted ads. Plus, it will only pick up on public social media accounts, so your embarrassing statuses on Facebook are safe, as long as your profile is private." 


Mobile in Cannes


The Cannes Lions ad festival will have something new this year: mobile vendors. AdAge's Kunur Patel talks to Velti, MMA's Greg Stuart, and other mobile players who are planning a presence. "It's a big step for an industry that's previously concentrated its efforts -- and marketing budgets -- at tech events like Mobile World Congress or CTIA. Those events have long been the domain of the carriers that have wielded so much power over the industry."

ROAS Vs CPA


Rocket Fuel's Jarvis Mak looks at the gooey world of online ad metrics and helps clarify a few things along the way in a think piece on iMedia Connection. He writes, "A better measure than cost per acquisition would be return on ad spend (ROAS), calculated off of the order amount when the transaction occurs. Obviously, there are high-end versus low-end customers, and it is quite possible to bring back low-end customers at a much faster clip than high-end customers. In fact, this was the case for one of our financial services campaigns."

Evidon, DoubleVerify Partner


Just in time to provide compliance with the EU ePrivacy Directive and U.S. Self Regulatory Program, DoubleVerify has agreed to integrate Evidon's privacy solution into its measurement platform. About a year ago, DoubleVerify was an Evidon competitor <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001_czQ7fyjvMKQnZ1RNhlberQUTCs43auQsM0gxo-gpFyCHQ9ANJ6Qte-3x52E3Ul1O1mpRXEXvDGixvv8XvHRAZaGlmo053TGqPZ-Hb1uirD_fJhooR4M4zjNcaDnGYrF7erxSw8DRATq-cVhEHEXQds5ctlFQ18ePDtqsmDvvkw=>  when it came to providing the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Advertising Option icon. But steadily ad verifier DoubleVerify has moved toward measurement, while Evidon has become a leader in the privacy compliance solutions space.

Cross-Platforming


Lotame tells MediaPost's Laurie Sullivan that their launching new cross-platform targeting tools as the company's Crowd Control data management platform (DMP) morphs into its next iteration. Sullivan explains the cross-platform angle, "Aside from managing mobile Web data, the platform integrates discrete audience-based data from a variety of first- and third-party sources, such as mobile apps, behavioral and demographic data, Web analytic tools, CRM data, point-of-sale data and other offline data sources."

Is Aggregate Data Anonymous? Not Always


Writing on the FTC's tech blog, chief technologist Ed Felton makes the case that aggregate data can pose a privacy threat. His key example is collaborative filtering systems, which recommend items based on past queries and purchase behavior within a population of users (Think: Amazon, Netflix). Felton explains, "If a system tells you that people who watch the TV show 'Alf' also watch 'Dallas,' this fact is aggregate information-essentially a correlation that is calculated across the entire user population. But given enough of this aggregate data, over time, it can become possible (depending on the details of the system) to infer what individual users have purchased and watched." It calls to mind AOL's disastrous public release in 2006 of "anonymous" search queries, which led the New York Times to track down searcher #4417749," one Thelma Arnold, a 62 year old widow living in Lilburn, Georgia.

New Acronym


Upstream Group's Doug Weaver follows up his declaration of war on acronyms and over-used ad tech phraseology with his own approved ad tech lexicon. He begins his latest missive meant to counsel the digital ad seller: "...one common question I've heard a dozen times this week is, 'So now that you've eliminated 90% of the key words we use in our presentations, what are we supposed to sell?' Simply put, start selling the Three Cs: Clarity, Certainty and Control." CCC!

Viewable Tsunami


Viewability metrics - called AdView - are now part of ad verification platform DoubleVerify as the race to offer better buying metrics intensifies. Mitchell Weinstein, adops maven at Universal McCann says in the release, "We've been using DoubleVerify for content verification for several years now. The addition of the AdView product gives us another layer of insights (...)."

Facebook, Data Hoarder


Facebook is now publicly traded - so why can't its user data be? In a Charlie Rose interview that aired last night, Google CEO Larry Page strikes a familiar note of frustration about Facebook's closed policy on sharing friend data. "You don't want to be holding your users hostage... We think it's important that you as users of Google can take your data, and take it out if you need to, or take it somewhere else." Venture Beat's Dylan Tweney picks up the interview. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001M9q4MDN9Y1REX3L_RQoi3APKQJcYkGvEv8TuAhuOFO7HzgbSz1lBlSV5V2D-8cpeCGXX6ALJVPK0auR-3-T-e6aZzo1lkpz0bOd_SMPVp64kRBtFL7ZGlK_9btwwWuWYWr7u3Ij04EYWU6b-R06Fvvfu9v8x0ngp1grQqhsySm8PPoHOHrtMRLlSnnmXevuw0erlhvWhCG_pu0oshkWo7tt4IXNco-2bs1TDtxSgAaza8ixgxUb2dQ==>  The issue may matter more to Google than Facebook's users, who don't seem to be clambering to upload their friend lists to Google+. Google on the other hand faces what may turn out to be its first intractable competitive disadvantage, especially if Microsoft and Facebook deepen their search relationship. 


VivaKi LiKes BlueKai


Vivaki has paired with BlueKai on a data offering called Audience Insights. The platform combines Vivaki's cookie syncing approach with BlueKai's DMP. "Instead of traditional 'tagging' of creative assets and Web pages - which can be cumbersome and potentially inhibit the consumer experience - Audience Insights reduces the complexity and increases scale by leveraging what is already in place."

From New Zealand's StopPress comes local anecdotes on the traction of audience buying through display advertising exchanges and sell-side platforms.

Keelhauling


Former AdExpose CEO and current comScore exec Kirby Winfield hops aboard his personal blog and writes that the brand-dollars-coming-online storyline is a fallacy. Winfield writes, "The idea of online publishers somehow keelhauling the established TV ad market is the single largest and most consistent fallacy this industry has propagated since its inception." Keelhaul more. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001M9q4MDN9Y1RtX4-r8BYM9hiv05tGwHgSUiM0Sm0W_i0yzx0jCIsDTbhcGxV67VjW3dwoAtIM2A5jLoKsSuKbzeWbMuiEQINYbWg_aRTHZvJVBvjhQh6c60fsFTTF8k2ggkrDT1ppH93h8PlgdIzS8iyUG17VxIImIRHO2i_HGJ2J_uogGV9JTXmohsGiZtFN>  


Reporting The Auction


Google is starting to report the results of a display ad auction in a new feature announced on Google's Inside AdWords report. To a degree, this is the sort of data that publishers have longed for. Group Product Manager Bhanu Narasimhan writes, "With the Auction insights report, you can compare your performance with other advertisers who compete in the same set of auctions as you do. You can see how often your ads rank higher than other advertisers' ads on the search results page, and how often your ads appear compared to theirs based on your estimated possible impressions." Programmatic buying is increasingly coming to the sales side.

Emerging Display


On ClickZ, Darryl Yan, avp in the Consumer Banking Group at DBS Bank, says emerging display ad publishers - think Skype - need to ramp beyond their "dumb pipe" offering if they're going to win brand dollars. "It is too simple to suggest that the availability of new online display inventory results in brands diverting their marketing budget to these emerging entrants. Online advertising is a highly competitive sector, and one response that established incumbents would use to fend off the entrant's challenge is to offer incentives to advertisers so as to prevent them diverting their marketing dollars."

It's ubiquitous: every iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch has one. It's immutable: it can't be changed, and users have no control over its access. The UDID has offered pretty much everything an advertiser could want for distinguishing unique users..." (visit AdExchanger.com)

'Buddy' Deal for GroupM


Business Insider's Jim Edwards sees "mandate" written all over a new preferred vendor deal between WPP and Buddy Media. "With Sorrell wanting to see his $5 million stake in Buddy Media pay off, there will be pressure on GroupM buyers to move their business from rival agencies-TBG, AdParlor, Adaptly, Blinq Media, 22Squared et al.-to Buddy Media and the Brighter Option unit it bought in February."

Under the deal, GroupM's MEC, Mindshare, MediaCom and other units will throw their considerable weight behind Buddy Media's social ads product. 


Maxing The CPM


On iMedia Connection, Rare Crowds CEO Eric Picard says that publishers need to start using the fancy new IAB ads which provide larger screen real estate for the advertiser. He explains, "Publishers also need to make sure that these new units are not held aside as special options and used like rich media has been used for more than a decade now -- as the way to preserve floor price. Yes, that's a good thing for us to do; publishers should be preserving floor price wherever they can. But if we don't aggressively move off of the long-in-the-tooth formats from 2002, we're going to continue to see overall CPM erode."

Have Brand Lift, Will Optimize


Don't believe online campaigns can be optimized for brand metrics? Vizu wants to teach you different. Fresh case studies for GE, Mary Kay and Jones New York aim to show social, custom content, and other brand ad types deliver lift in mushy metrics like brand recognition and purchase intent - and that such intelligence can be fed back into campaigns.

Ad network Tremor Video is looking to carve out a greater niche across mobile, as the space finally begins to close in on something close to the scale major advertisers and media buyers demand. The company's introducing its Mobile Creative Platform for all the major smartphone models including Apple's iPhone and Google's Android systems. "Mobile advertisers and publishers are making great strides into new formats like HTML5, but they still have trouble delivering a consistent ad experience across the mobile landscape," said Yichel Chan, VP and GM, Mobile and CTV for Tremor Video. Having a single format for serving mobile ads on all major devices could be a good step to making that happen.

Selling The Ad Network


Video search engine and ad network Blinkx reported its fiscal Q4 earnings yesterday and also divulged the particulars of its acquisition of ad network Burst Media (read 2011 AdExchanger Q <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001Ij-CCofLlDsocGYHItiGepTS9VfIN8rNnbHFN_mbr0_dON0Mnu91dHxJHj0LQWU-_ppKUV3jJKtojCQYTzgn2pyMTdNjuKt2sQ9xS3cQ0slCccbG6DxDD-tTk7OtQ8zwezOQgHdQ7H1JpTH3aftmdHuMPh20UKH5pbbajHrfrRyMHo-BdJsZPg==> &A), which eventually sold for nearly $40 million considering Blinkx's rising stock price. From the release, "The purchase consideration comprised equity of $29.3 million, $0.5 million cash and $1.4 million of costs associated with the acquisition and amounts owing to Burst Media Corporation shareholders. As a result of movement in the share price between announcing the agreement and completion, there was an up lift to the equity consideration of $9.2 million bringing the overall equity to $38.5 million and total consideration to $40.4 million."

As Good As TV


Sony is turning to ad serving platform ZEDO for its Multi Screen Media (SONY Entertainment Television India) unit to help improve the performance of ads on its online video player. And by "improving," the company believes it will be more reflective of the kind of premium experience associated with broadcast. Sony will use ZEDO's VAST video ad platform for the ads in place of its existing SAAS-based system. "TV advertising is still the best," said Roy de Souza, founder of ZEDO. "I believe that as publishers run VAST video ads on the web, online advertising will become as good as TV."

Fewer Stupid Advertisers


On ClickZ, Andrew Goodman looks at how Google runs its business and wonders if there is trouble ahead: "More and more advertisers doing a better job at measuring is largely good for Google, because it puts the price of a click on a solid foundation. If one advertiser decides clicks are too expensive, the market is smart enough to step in and buy the same click for roughly the same price. But has Google forgotten that more measurement leaves fewer stupid advertisers in the auction whose pockets you pick when you anticipate a weak quarter or two?"

DNT Twitter


Do-Not-Track standardization on Twitter's platform will partially cut the legs out from under one of its personalization features. ClickZ's Kate Kaye reports on the Firefox browser implementation, "When users who have DNT enabled on their browser visit any web page that features the Twitter tweet button (just about every content or e-commerce site has one) Twitter will not track that page visit." Read more <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001jQPOBoptP5Dq7_bye-YMjt7b-5Na5G7JjvDmqN8TVgaO09-fewH8IXeLuYzC3X5p-izysMJbx9Y0HD9Ly-GREyzGjEQgGeVPVKs1porhAlYByNoKyHtL7RNhmiF5MeTHV_4nfzDdryra7bv-Mu_hLs3UO1FWHGsIHobqZd4tgF8QZGMBvtTCuoxwUt9G8Ehw> . And, read the Twitter DNT page <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001jQPOBoptP5Dt6dweedkpeD244nP8VZGEP68QcCfk9s2JEvIxYIIWd7h6mTTxbIFiuoDwjqRxVLCORJUK6QfCHiG8l4Py51VlvENVIt2UASfFhhSYGbznoiM6lOPPu9T1Q3GzZSHCT32wAGAYGgwf1Q==> . This sort of compliance will affect all of your favorite sharing buttons (pixels!) eventually. For companies like Twitter using the sharing button strategy, there are two key data sets that this affects: the Twitter users who use DNT and then non-Twitter DNT users who still find their way to the Twitter pixel whether they are a Twitter user or not. They both provide signal to Twitter. If a web-wide Twitter ad network were launched, targeting would be affected for those non-Twitter users who run DNT, too. 


The Tablet Ad Takeover


The home page takeover ad is coming to the Kindle Fire as tablet display advertising grows. Ad Age's Jason Del Rey reports, "[Amazon] has been telling ad agency execs that they must spend about $600,000 for any package that includes such an ad. The ad campaigns would run for two months and also include inventory from Amazon's "Special Offers" product. For $1 million, advertisers would get more ad inventory..." No takers so far it appears. But, the display sellers are active at Amazon!

He is cautiously hopeful, "[Yahoo!] still a lot of work to do. We're encouraged by a potential deal, and also the prospects of Yahoo! monetizing the remainder of its Alibaba stake down the line as that asset should continue to strengthen. However, it's clear Yahoo! still has a lot of work to do in its core operating business as it looks to re-gain traction in both display and search, and also targets new opportunities in commerce." 


Foursquare (Local) Ads


Foursquare is looking at a new ads platform to monetize its 20 million users. Ad Age's Cotton Delo writes, "Foursquare is eyeing mid-summer for the launch of its paid-media platform, which will include a product that allows merchants to promote their deals. When users search for local specials, they'll be able to see offers via paid ads." The targeting will come from Foursquare's own algos says Delo. If buyers could map their own cookie pools (first-party data) to Foursquare's, that might be even more interesting. Mobile privacy constraints likely prevent it.

Hating The IPO


Inexplicably, many in the press and watching at home seem to be thinking the Facebook IPO was a dud as the price didn't rocket into the stratosphere on Friday. Read this one in the L.A.

What gives? ... Seems to me Facebook got as much as it possibly could and just raised $16 billion - it can now easily dip into the public markets if it wants more, too. Good for them.

Guaranteed Audience


Nielsen's Online Campaign Ratings product has been getting some traction as the company looks to bring traditional TV and online closer together. Those brand dollars are there somewhere - I'm just sure of it! Steve Hasker, the president of Nielsen's watch business, tells MediaPost, "What we're seeing is a real step toward the creation of a currency, and the evidence around that is the fact that both buyers and sellers of advertising inventory are using the product to guarantee the delivery of an audience."

Predicting Digital


On the DoubleClick For Publisher blog, Google VP of Product Neal Mohan revisits his predictions for ads from a year earlier as well as comments he made at Wednesday's LUMA Partners' Digital Media Summit. He also makes new predictions such as: "25% of brands will favor digital ads over all other media. -This is a pretty bold prediction, considering today this number is probably close to none. So why are we so bullish? First, audiences continue to move online: in 2011, households with broadband internet but with no cable TV, increased 23% (Nielsen Cross-Platform Report Q3'11)." Second, YouTube. Third, is measurement. Read all the predictions <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001OPNcMQCtINCwTWEUjNsbZ0I1LE6gmq2jYrebXKJLA-ojK1YyiwSMrdPXzVkd7RHebH5jrj4aYijhd8Vy18nAGm9-YhQlQCYPN1DK9AVKrmJCG1dnWNmHeCQ6y8EyHGqRsUflXMwsCPxPMa69TERzqjcza1FGIb2INqZo2oM5qRF2zLrYAxRXuryGM3wwbn4_R5RwalDfy_rZw51Q2NE-9w==> . 


DNT Meet DNS


From his Upstream Group blog, Doug Weaver creates the Do-Not-Say List as he is fed up with some industry terms used by sellers. He writes, "I've concluded that there are several phrases and terms in our industry that have now lost all meaning and, if used, actually do harm to the seller's cause." Full Transparency: this list is brand-safe, speaks to the optimization capabilities of DSPs and their partners, and uses every popular word on AdExchanger.

B2B Display


B2B data and ad platform Bizo has launched Business Audience Exchange which it says is a real-time bidding (RTB) exchange for display ads which aggregates over 1,000 B2B publishers. Read the release. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001OPNcMQCtINDNP653aVBhtLbd8mSJrScZuSg4-w-GZ5nrq57yuXSLST49i99n2hoITZ3W2SSVbc0KObX-Fs1XeAs1V7XphbKlBK8_P7ONC-8gAy-IM34IBG3Gr_57L-G4tal0ulNSctdBBkh1zSx0regtLtXwYtJ0WVWLO8sAM9-e8nPQtyBPhgnzZC_lULHYolfVsRa0A_bTPcZ-mNseFnElrqanc19qRIBJHo3RJcO1VXzPKrrDpNmI_PZA_6mY740BAyMpF3A=>  The company explains that the new exchange is built on AppNexus and that it maintains "publisher integrity through blind access." B2B publishers enjoy unique, specialized audience. Hence the enhanced importance of publisher controls preventing "data leakage" and channel conflict. 


RTB Kool-Aid


Casale Media's Andrew Casale delivers the real-time bidding gospel in an opinion piece on MediaPost. He doesn't hold back, "RTB automation will lift CPMs and create new display advertising opportunities, as evidenced by the trend of publishers creating private marketplaces that facilitate direct deals with agencies. These relationships lift a publisher out of the sea of impressions available for bid on open exchanges and create demand by enhancing the overall consideration for the impressions."

Charity Audience


The Drum in the UK profiles a digital campaign for an aid group, and they're using an array of digital ad notables: "The digital campaign combines data and media from Quantcast and Tribal Fusion, with real time advertising bought through MediaMath to reach charity givers, and a TV ad has been created ...".

The Financial Ad Exchanges


"Ad exchanges are not like the stock market and never will be... thankfully." This is the title for interclick strategy guy and Yahoo! product VP Jason Lynn's post on his personal blog as he talks exchanges and audience buying. He concludes, "In the end, we need to stop thinking of ad exchanges as some nascent stock exchange and that the ad whole industry will look like Wall Street in 10 years (thankfully). The reality is that ad placements and financial instruments serve entirely different purposes."

Engaging The Server


Brand engagement player Moat has made a deal with WPP Group's 24/7 Media to embed Moat tech into the 24/7 ad server. The release explains <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001oP9MQEgkx10gwmzm3XDhaGhG8VMmm3G6NQcBi6UuqyPRni5GMIqVgUYZQD56M7V7hH_WLM2kRPZiO8qQmeZrpeXa5TmlgPtWsVlx2DdFjUaITGet2VXJvVnfgCjHUvx1YftmXOB1K9eQ2u7AOXFZuXLVr_UG5AxANER7KZEwUJN1dx4TDVuydenb3wn3UMVlljo7FGwJzdvqTyfMZWwgG9zfAZ6sdrWP> , "Publishers using 24/7 Media's propriety ad serving technology, 24/7 Open AdStream, can utilize Moat's solution through a simple integration, and instantly begin measuring viewable impressions, and engagement levels in real-time." This is an interesting deal. Brand aren't intereted in clickthrough rate. And, Vizu and KN Dimestore have been been the brand awareness solution when ad networks or DSPs want to add brand metrics through surveys. Now, Moat is getting in through the ad server with its non-survey approach (detailed in Moat's recent funding release <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001oP9MQEgkx12NBL-CyIAKkdvCsxVsRLf8uBg5ISc1XLa_zV8dVLIxI2ITVDkYnkUl2jswi0r6FpZFOb5ZWrpXRcHxfM2Radvg8rpIpqSRov7lDxvP4HCet1df3DX9bVPNNKC36j6EQW52PTaVJ32iyQ==> ). At WPP, it would follow that Moat tech could propagate beyond Open AdStream and into 24/7's ad network, Xaxis, The Mig and, therefore, WPP agencies.

It also gives publishers more control - they need to approve any client that will start running on their inventory. They are able to set all the different floors and minimums as needed. And, we've chosen a partner (Krux) which will give publishers full data protection on any of the advertisers running inside of the Brand Exchange - and full transparency into what's taking place within their data."

Buying Video


DSP/DMP Turn announced that its intertwining engagement metrics for video advertising bought through its platform as online video ad buying continues to grow. The release talks about how historical audience data is used as the company says the new video ad feature will "predict users who are most likely to view video ads to completion and also predicts users most likely to take action on ads." Track completions, track clicks - and retarget.

Dogs And Display


Ecommerce site rep firm Triad Retail Media is getting more into content marketing with a "social" flavor as the company announced it's working with Sams Club to create PetCentral which targets pet owner audience on SamsClub.com. The release explains, "accredited pet expert Dr. Louise Murray, who will spearhead the development of a variety of social media content such as Q&As and videos that cover topics like pet vaccinations and choosing the best food for your pet." Rich media is even richer. Branded entertainment, social marketing, content marketing - whatever you want to call it - is becoming the creative for digital ads and, don't forget there's a rich treasure trove of data in play, too, as audience is aggregated. Display is not just a banner ad.

Facebook OS


As you likely know, the Facebook IPO is today. You knew that, right? Ken Allen of investment advisor Blackstone looks at the valuation of Facebook and its potential in a detailed post on the Blackstone Blog. Allen writes, "The story that Facebook is telling on its roadshow is one consistent with massive growth over an extended timeframe. It is telling a story much grander and more interesting than that of a communications tool, photo sharing platform, or social application. Facebook is telling a story of a social platform akin to an operating system, upon which an increasingly greater share of future applications will be built, including those associated with commerce, payments, games, media, and mobile computing."

No "Like", GM?

 

 The Wall Street Journal reports that General Motors will stop advertising on Facebook. No "like", GM? The WSJ says, "GM, started to re-evaluate its Facebook strategy earlier this year after its marketing team began to question the effectiveness of the ads. GM marketing executives (...) met with Facebook managers to address concerns about the site's effectiveness and left unconvinced advertising on the website made sense..."

Growing Up For Big Data


Offering the "Big Data Analysis Maturity Curve" on ClickZ, IBM Netezza's Brad Terrell says in an opinion piece that if you're going to take advantage of "big [media-related] data," you're going to need - people! Terrell sees the talent shortage as a significant, "Talented data scientists - individuals with a combination of data management expertise, analytics modeling knowledge, and business analysis skills - are so hard to find because many technologies needed to tame big data didn't exist until recently. Most were invented within the past 10 years.


Don't Forget The Email Channel


In an interview with the Boston Globe, HubSpot marketing manager Jessica Meher says that her marketing automation company began to seriously consider "adding e-mail marketing services last year after it purchased Cambridge start-up Performable, which had been developing analytical tools to measure the effectiveness of online campaigns." She adds, "One of the team's first projects was to develop an e-mail marketing platform that was tightly integrated with the rest of HubSpot's offerings. 'We weren't interested in e-mail marketing as a silo,' Meher said."

TV Versus Online Video Eyeballs


Sure consumers are spending more time online than ever before but did you know... that the viewing of television programming grew a whopping 28% in the last year "with consumers citing factors such as convenience and the appeal and variety of programming as their top factors for the increase. Two-thirds of consumers said HDTVs were their primary viewing devices, though other devices such as laptops (62%), desktops (55%), smartphones (33%) and tablets (17%) were gaining in popularity."

Mobile Ads Report


Mobile ad network Millennial Media reported its earnings yesterday. Yes, that's right, Millennial Media is a public company in case you've forgotten and every three months you will get a taste of how the mobile display advertising market is performing. How conveeeeeeeeenient. TechCrunch paraprhases the news for Q1 2012: "For the year, Millennial is looking at $173 million and 176 million in annual revenues, which would be up by 68 percent from the year before. But that's actually lower than the $202.8 million analysts were expecting on average, according to a Bloomberg survey." Oh, those pesky surveys.

Display Snafu


A live, video sharing website is the subject of Canada's CBC feature article on the perils of brands advertising online. Advertisers Tim Hortons, Rogers, Home Depot and Bank of Montreal are among the companies whose AdSense ads as well as those of other "web ad placement services" were apparently displayed on a site called Stickam - "where young teens engage in public, sexually explicit exchanges via live webcam and text," says CBC. Google spokesperson Andrew Swartz admits in the article, "Google has strict policies in place regarding the content of pages that show AdSense ads, which are enforced by sophisticated automated systems and human review. Due to the dynamic nature of website content, however, we do not always immediately detect content that violates our policies." DSP DataXu is also implicated. DataXu vp of biz dev Adrian Tompsett tells AdExchanger via email, "This is an issue the entire industry faces as a majority of the content today is generated by consumers. The problem stems from the generic, inaccurate way exchanges categorize sites, hindering the brand safety and categorization software designed to filter it. We are always working with our exchange partners like Google to ensure the quality of the inventory."

Consumers who were regular users of a brand resulted in more than a 48 percent in-store sales lift, with a 23 percent lift for buyers of competitive brands."

Yahoo! Reverb


The online ads world is still reverberating from the executive changes at Yahoo!. Wall Street offers up its thoughts as J.P. Morgan's Doug Anmuth notes the low lights, "Potential impact on employee retention/recruitment and Alibaba. According to AllThingsD Levinsohn sought to ease employees' concerns on Sunday in an internal memo after the slew of changes were announced. However, we believe both employee recruitment and retention could become more challenging going forward if Yahoo!'s leadership situation remains unresolved for long. Additionally, last week The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo! was working on a potential taxable deal to monetize 15% to 25% of Alibaba Group-less than Yahoo!'s 40%+ stake overall. We believe the recent Board and CEO changes could delay this potential Alibaba deal, which might be disappointing to certain investors focused on a near-term transaction." Mark Mahaney at Citi continues the discussion and says, "... there's also a broader question that YHOO hasn't effectively addressed in years. Should Yahoo! be run for Growth or for Value? We believe, in part due to mounting competitive pressures, that Yahoo! should be run for Value - share buybacks, dividends, Asia asset sales, etc... We'll patiently wait for evidence of this strategy before considering becoming constructive on the shares, despite what appears to currently be a reasonable valuation." Yahoo is worth about $19 billion right now <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001NXmj1yCQJfHKxC5RKMJgKBOVDxH1PYJnCjjM_4BT2-UjM0UBlIwQaIg92-6lxnT9CU-gdX8ILg0laHlfZ4bJUV7bq8_rNtpQDWlW4Ew66Oy043m06yAAurOEozwlj8F53QbL0TSvKBGVhOnr6HWYRLVDBBoog7x8d0nf27DD4ZI=> .

Measuring Big Ads


Microsoft Advertising UK Research Manager Tim Lumb shares the results from a new study on his company's blog that shows the IAB rising stars (big ads!) formats far outpace their diminutive brethren when it comes to key performance metrics. Lamb writes, "The premium formats are show to be more effective than the standard formats, especially in with regards to consideration (twice as effective, from 3% to 6%) and opinion (two-and-a-half times more effective than standard formats). In terms of creative evaluation, the premium formats outperformed standard across all measures, especially in differentiation, click intent and purchase intent."

The Case For Exchanges


UK-based trading desk Infectious Media scores a DoubleClick case study as Google lights the fuse (again) to entice demand-side platforms to buy (and buy again).

Yahoo! Removes Thompson


It's official: Scott Thompson has been removed as CEO of Yahoo!. According to a release, the new interim CEO will be Ross Levinsohn. Activist investor Daniel Loeb was a winner, too, as his picks for the Yahoo! board will be installed sooner rather than later: "Under the Board's settlement agreement with [Daniel Loeb's] Third Point, three Third Point nominees - Daniel S. Loeb, Harry J. Wilson, and Michael J. Wolf - will join the Yahoo! Board, effective May 16, 2012. " Read it <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001q9-yi4G8HmWl7pSHPOElK5_ar50mbXah-aTYSXj8FZROKHYpLCj-G87zAwbdq9v3RdRSUnzBaQwaeZzjnvMv148M8B6DJxZuqN175nU9j17gL947ZOVyNMv9lduG21AVV_v1TbpBExXLeTzXmLWF9vNji0aeAdLFpwq2Bnm-0kNwbGu1wftkS7k2L45KmmodMTBKDEFGFvK-0MKzuwwqwoTq4oW-_qGd5KBBJurLjXs=> .

CEO search? What happens next? 

Levinsohn Reaction 

Meanwhile, the kudos pour in for Levinsohn who many hope will lose the "interim" in his new title. Yahoo! interclick CEO Michael Katz said in a tweet <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001q9-yi4G8HmULRpmbYxojTaWJ1MqSNSWEsqf1OxYW0Qm6YOgblJV9SPRdZbctXTAoA0xbIySIRst8OyrBPaXu5ngdGilM-sYyq_DRTGlVtnJ8VkBLmpv5ITxF--xHSp3gyR2vEif5y0t2v7pf-zut906OC6xOAvqlEvHoV1-49ow=> , "could not be happier for @rosslevinsohn and for Yahoo as the news becomes official. Y! could not possibly be in better hands." From Steven Rosenbaum at Forbes, "And while Scott Thompson - the now ousted CEO - was famous for saying that he didn't much understand advertising or media, Levinsohn understands both. And he's careful not to over promise and under deliver." Read it <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001q9-yi4G8HmVY_CpgyE_Jza0YtuyzrWmWYkuTh-Une5xSHAsuRpOawr7OqaDxIwnQuHLO7JciQu35ihRaN1r8HvVe_7a_g2KDU95BBjyCnzlNfNguQ5gtIHmwo1UhqthNpw3Eci48bmAozbNr5EWOrGijXFY_K5BfHBcI4gS353zcKtqA23nc6FnPCwMLJz5fZTkKseF-XQ2NYv_hv5qU6bhyK0Yrw49D> . COO Craig Atkinson of Omnicom Group tells The Wall Street Journal that "Levinsohn was a 'known quantity' who has made progress in developing Yahoo's credibility as a next-generation media company. He cited the company's 'strong showing' at its recent 'Newfront' event in which it unveiled its new slate of Web shows for advertisers."

Google Buying Meebo?


All Things D's Liz Gannes says that her sources tell her Google will acquire Meebo for $100 million or so. Read more. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001q9-yi4G8HmU5DxzG9mUCK9MgOiyyam-SrXY1Jy4SqMiiQNmnO_c3aWiR4Kmw64htAGPUgdbKmKJDLcfIn8pAHUlgYUzeAKWqBotus914lhdskb37zyUPuiEIXPKOmANH9sDKRqVSbUcVAx2QXZp_Wz7u-oENOdXE2_btk4eDxf3-fxmZCI8J5g==>  As you may recall, toolbar maker Meebo acquired psychographic targeter Mindset Media for an undisclosed sum in early 2011. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001q9-yi4G8HmU3EZprShMrRcNgCNUfghc8nN2I9RXfnDBDk6l74g4SyVrdXnw1lcDLR8HAgk_LXl5AbTM7ozPCiDUNg94zFJyO0c2dlWXqXml21c7krdYS5pxfzakkcXpvJVI6FoSxaqMHKnM3AFKUbl1raF_9iQYxxlhyHMQbOtI=>  So why buy? I'll toss out there that this is potentially about finding more solutions for brand advertisers and speaks to a templated, branded entertainment capability that leverages the data gathered through Meebo's toolbar (which is tracking users and measuring engagement). This solution could also leverage "interest" data that is gathered across the network of AdSense publishers as well as fill/extend the AdSense inventory itself. Scale for the big brand is a big deal. See Meebo.com <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001q9-yi4G8HmUubLwNNyDCSA07w3qqPJC6RZ316eEWnYNY5pg5NlxwUjeIv2pfN8CX6RAJzint_kIph3jwXH5qf8hX2GSW2NqLB28PT1UigZ4=> . Or, maybe it's an acqui-hire?


Social Is For Brands


Former Microsoft Atlas "Engagement Mapping" (attribution) guru Young-Bean Song is not sold on the social search update coming to Bing and provided a comment on social ads, in general, as MediaPost's Laurie Sullivan paraphrased: "Song said when companies run traditional campaigns in social media, they are almost always disappointed because it's not a channel for buying and selling products. Facebook will not become a great engine for commerce or direct-response, but rather, branding." D.R. mavens would likely dispute this saying - at the very least - FB will be a great vehicle for D.R., too.

The Video Ad Platform


Poof! ValueClick has a video ad platform. The company announced last week that it was "beefing" up its video product line as it looks to leverage its ad network and access to other exchange-like video ad inventory sources. Oh, and its leveraging its data, too. According to the release, "ValueClick Video advertisers receive exclusive access to 212MM unique online user profiles and $6.7B in transactional data to pinpoint the ideal audience from display, to smartphones and tablet devices."

CMO Target


James Rogers covers last week's IBM investors meeting on TheStreet.com. Rogers paraphrases IBM CEO Ginni Rommety: "Rometty also promised continued aggressive investment in R&D, an area where IBM has spent $70 billion over the last 10 years. Additionally, the CEO said that IBM wants to expand its client base beyond the traditional CIOs to CFOs, Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs), risk officers, supply chain managers and public sector leaders such as police chiefs and mayors."

Transformer Publisher


On Digiday, Josh Sternberg profiles The Atlantic Media Company and its transformation from a print publication to a digital publication whose traffic swamps the print rage by 25x. The Atlantic's president Justin Smith tells Sternberg, "We decided that we wanted to be a digital media company participating in the high-growth markets and digital media. We went about the process of thinking through the questions, how do we disrupt our own company if we were challenging digital brands attacking us?"

DG, And MediaMind, Report


DG said its "segment" (MediaMind, Unicast, Eyewonder) generated $31 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2012. Relatively flat. By the way, that's three display-centric companies reporting varying degrees of flatness - or less than expected growth in their business: Aol (U.S. display) <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001M1s2bZWaeEavluis8Il796PvnO-6DAXdb4F7c6MXZRfGRKGPIVoTKtd6UtPayI99A66yAoBU87JE4jptfxrMjJJnfRMJ1J9QYrRGg1grjR5cK0fm2RkPsI5tSPpB6Bfy4oueRs-ffYq3QkDwI1dNeNNU9E4lfUqizwKG5nG3eaLO1sU1QNRbTSNQCXoPq34tzkjESsK_yNP3cQgsKFmN02VzKzI8vMPtmdVg63Yj6SA=> , DG and ValueClick (less than expected future growth <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001M1s2bZWaeEa3t0WCx-b_ePx-bOPHTgDi66rlGnlvmvLv9CK1eCQ7kyGYhxymHn2SdKZwVzWV0KquB8OZBqfsyNBWNTr7BgiWdE3uPVaodA1hSWwonkM3QwkaozNW1gdebpnJCw6romHZdreo_0_Ly2OJ8fG7Xf1om8yfcHjhNCqCNwjjLTPSC5TMg2kpMo0-xzYRGGEEKTwcvcNtsy8bjg==> ).

ThinkEquity analyst Robert Coolbrith provides his Wall Street view: "[DG] reported Q1 results in line with the company's preannouncement and higher than our forecast; the company also maintained Fiscal Year 2012 guidance (adjusted for the Peer39 acquisition). However, management reported that the online business is experiencing near-term headwinds related to merger integration and that pro forma online revenue was flat year-over-year. Despite these issues (which we expect will be temporary), we continue to view [DG] as a value-oriented play on display advertising automation (which we continue to view as among the most attractive growth segments in interactive advertising)."


Rebrand Alert


Chairman Hooman Radfar tells The Business Insider that his company is changing its name to its core product - AddThis, which he says now reaches 1.3 billion uniques per month. That's a lotta cookies. Read it <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001M1s2bZWaeEY1WVZA-Uk8JMDSoA9myaMEMdIBym0ooUBtzA5LN8f2bOxYjJwIYyGLY_oujYOH9W4jCWACsEHt3R-0dLaadp_hqHyGHVf7JvGU8yrgsdqnOHWDr2eu3KHGTyXBQM8Dm67SNCGmaqgIz1Wdzp5s8DT3g81pwyOxp7KAPDmJW4qPU7SCq_4z_ygL00VSbnGKqL2zmi0mieTosw==> . And, in an effort to get even tighter with publishers who help generate AddThis' sharing data, CEO Ramsey McGrory tells AdExchanger that the company is adding more tools and widgets for publishers.

In part, AddThis leverages the datasets collected from publishers in order to sell to advertisers who use it for targeting, after all. 


Bridge Goes Down For Mobile


In Adweek, Tim Peterson covers a new startup called Drawbridge started by former AdMob exec Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan. Once again, a mobile ad tech company is looking to solve the mobile Holy Grail - effective targeting. Another twist is that Drawbridge is looking to work across devices and around mobile cookie/privacy concerns. Peterson says Drawbridge claims "it can sidestep that [privacy] issue by algorithmically correlating data to make essentially highly educated guesses as to whether a desktop user and mobile user are one and the same."

The Display Commodity 


On MediaPost, Martini Media's biz dev exec Bill Rowley cuts to the chase and says display is a commodity and offers a few tips on to make the most of your pork bellies. He admits its pretty basic marketing but says in his last bullet: "Your ad inventory should be tied to original content. Work with your editorial team to produce engaging content that can be sponsored by a relevant brand. Advertisers want to be part of the story."

Replacing The Ad Banner


Brian Morrissey interviews Gawker maestro Nick Denton on Digiday. Denton is an ad banner "hater" and thinks "in a couple of years I could see "'discussion management' being more important than traditional online advertising." Can you see social listening tools in an auction environment? Why not?

Harris pours the digital Kool-Aid, "Because of the Internet's ability to be responsive and react in milliseconds, it's also possible to take this further and incorporate the notion of real-time.

Social Ads Reach


Social ads platform Adapt.ly raised another $10.5 million (Time Warner threw down) and announced a new product called Evergreen yesterday. TechCrunch says that the product echoes Facebook's own Reach Generator product. Adapt.ly CEO Nikhil Sethi tells TC that the product is priced according to reach and does not use a CPC, CPM or CPA model. CPR? (My acronym, not Adapt.ly's) The idea is that by advertising in a social environment, the marketer gets its branded content beyond the reach of what it may normally receive organically on Facebook. And, there's more. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001d6zt04_-DNgmmKBzvdho7lvX3HEdoYvC8noJbR-x3uXgmWg5eU7jrxgnMUotPn3BVda2iHkZnHNX3IEfzPf0T4q3MYDRUCf_JA8VWSDDb_SFAJkC3VTIuhIpz6uI6CK2_oxFfcoXJy8AyWNhJzM09nb_Kbvpu-Kl>  Display and automated content marketing are becoming one.

Pounding On The Keys


On Ad Age, Quantacast vp of product Jay Duggal brings the music of display advertising to readers and explains what he sees as the keys for effective real-time bidding (RTB) in display. Among his points, you need to use gobs of data: "RTB still requires petabytes of data, for two reasons. First, data freshness -- less data means more dated insights and greater sensitivity to cookie deletion. Second, targeting models are only as good as the amount and quality of data against which they train."

Tech Supremacy


A new study claims to show that New York has passed Boston for tech supremacy. Silicon Valley remains the clear leader. Full disclosure: the firm that did the study is based in NYC.

The Times' Patrick McGeehan explains, "One reason that the development of digital technology seems to be taking root in [New York City] is that the current wave of innovation is not about designing computers or microchips or building infrastructure for the Internet, but about devising creative applications of mobile technology for various industries." Interesting to note that bandwidth remains a bottleneck for some locations in NYC.

Gartner's Jim Davies and Bill Gassman write, "The acquisition will expand Tealeaf's worldwide sales and service coverage and increase funding for accelerated R&D. By 2Q13, tighter integration with the rest of IBM's Smarter Commerce portfolio will be achieved, but the solution will be offered to IBM customers immediately due to the unobtrusive nature of its deployment."

Digitizing The Agency


In a Q&A on Digiday, Digiday's Brian Morrisey asks Mike Parker who is chief digital and innovation officer at McCann Erickson if a "chief digital officer" is still needed. He thinks so: "Agencies still need to move farther and faster to bring in more digital talent and understand how to play in the digital landscape for clients, understand technology and the social landscape and bring it all together for clients. There's still a lot of places in organizations where they need to understand digital processes (...)."

Selling To Agencies


Upstream Group's and seller confidant Doug Weaver says that if you're selling to agencies, you need to be sensitive to their, potentially, precarious world. He offers several examples, "Senior agency executives live in perpetual anxiety over a major account going into review. That's a seismic event. But the more subtle, persistent agida comes from the soft erosion of clients inviting other shops in on a 'project' basis. If you're not talking about how your services and capabilities can help the agency drive interest and loyalty with the client, you are missing a big opportunity."

And drugs are at the root of it all. In a post on the comScore blog, marketing VP Mangano writes, "So while the amount of traffic that goes to a branded drug site from a click is relatively small, it is highly qualified traffic. As a result, while the click on a banner ad may not be an appropriate metric for many industries, it remains an important measure of ad effectiveness for the pharma industry."

Tablet (Ad) Trends


New data pulsing from mobile ad network Jumptap shows that Kindle Fire usage has hit a speed bump said the Company. From the release on the Jumptap blog, "Kindle Fire usage soared on the Jumptap network following the winter holiday season. In January, the Fire represented 33 percent of all tablet usage on the network, rivaling iPad's 48 percent share. Since then, Kindle Fire's share of traffic has decreased to 22 percent, most likely due to the successful launch of iPad3."

Post Acquisition Acquisition


It seems Amobee hasn't stopped acquiring in spite of the fact the mobile advertising firm was acquired by telecom company Singtel in January. Amobee said in a release yesterday that it had acquired AdJitsu as "Amobee will leverage AdJitsu's cutting-edge technology to accelerate the innovation of highly interactive and spectacular 3D mobile ads." 3D in a phone? See the AdJitsu site for an example <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001zKswmdXiljYPWGPTdA09CSC8mMrx47diWK_WDVH1MTAARZZxm2i5wu2SpHeyleuM9vE6GEk2uQ8Obs798uzI5aFC3N2yiW4rmDU7OZGlb_s=> .

'Algo' Change At FB


Nieman Journalism Lab's Justin Ellis reports that Google isn't the only one that can make a change in an algo and hugely effect traffic to digital properties. Facebook has apparently affected a few including The Guardian. Guardian's Tanya Cordrey tells Ellis about her company's experience, "We're still learning a lot about our Facebook app, and as with all brand new content platforms, (...) Major changes made in the last month or so by Facebook have indeed resulted in a fall in usage since early April. However, this is not a signal that users are 'abandoning' social reader apps, rather that articles which were previously surfaced predominantly in a user's newsfeed are now much less visible."

Stories like this make publishers nervous as they decide whether or not to publish more content through Facebook. But with so much traffic, can publishers risk NOT being on FB? 


The DSP Invasion


DSPs and audience buying are alive and well in China as AvasuDSP announced that it, too, is offering an "end-to-end solution" for media buying through RTB and other demand sources.

Shopper Marketing


Shopper Marketing has attracted yet another investment. Rich Relevance said that it has raised $20 million in funds as startups try to build out and ride the eCommerce wave. Read the release <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001fU7dBWXtjJtI4EGUKtzoQcat0Fn91R_Y_wNcci00tIskvj5UnhfoegU4Z_wBEDi8XojTu52Qa8ddWK7Yr4FldgfZE0iLJHuHD90IRId7xdQhuh4WltYLPn34TS1YI0nSVSKGq1kevpksP1jqWkBFjty4ojHVpuczaAUs_SxLtO13CqVymT7UHVT70vmvXdaMnMoOlR0Im1Yo_THOTQ0xZT9Jn-jNuc_jbpF_SlBODCyGxJB9eWCQ2Q==> . Ecommerce companies, which are sometimes the digital offshoots of brick-and-mortar retailers, are starting to look more like your everyday web publisher as content drives yield. The "shopper" is the reader when it comes to eCommerce, of course. Hence, the shopper marketing opportunity. Rich Relevance says in the release that its advertising offerings are used by "Colgate, 3M, P&G, AT&T, Verizon, Toyota and Cisco to engage shoppers on the world's largest retail sites with custom content while they are researching and purchasing products." As you may recall, RichRelevance bought retailer search monetization company Searchandise last December for an undisclosed sum.

comScore said yesterday that it as added new consumer engagement measurement capabilties for mobile. Dubbed Mobile Metrix 2.0, the company claims in a release that the product "enables reporting of unduplicated audience sizes across [mobile] app and browser usage, providing a comprehensive view of the complete media brand reach on mobile devices." comScore say it's "combining passive on-device measurement with census-level data" to bubble up data points like demographic reach and audience size.

Retargeting For Travel


Vacation.com owner Travel Leaders Group announced a new retargeting initiative for its travel agent members. Travel Leaders Group CMO Stephen McGillivray tells Travel Agent Central how it works: "'Retargeting with ads is not a new phenomenon. What is new is that we are the first agent organization to come out with retargeting and following customers' online behavior after an initial e-mail offer is sent.' Vacation.com generates and designs a supplier e-mail, sending it to members' customers in the database. If the consumer clicks on that e-mail, it goes to a personalized landing page of that agent that has more offers and details."

Inside The VC


Though not ad tech specific, Geekwire points to a new report released by Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation which suggests that the venture capital world may be broken -or at least have significant "challenges." Geekwire's John Cook says the Foundation report calls into question the "2 and 20" compensation method for VC partners: "This arrangement means that VCs often get paid well, even when performance is poor and they don't return investor capital. In essence, the report suggest that VCs get paid "to build funds, not build companies."

Video Ads Blow-up


Sounds destructive, but PointRoll BD guy Adam Caroll has created a new post on his company's blog that will be of assistance to any video ad seller looking to make the case for "why online video advertising is blowing up." He sees recent mobile measurement initiatives as a firestarter: "In the past six months we have seen multiple vendors such as Nielsen and comScore introduce an 'online' GRP (Gross Rating Point) metric. While debate will continue as to whether this is the best way to measure online video performance, one thing it does do is provide a meaningful way to compare online video versus TV performance and ensure video is in the mix when it comes to budget allocation."

adscale Gets RTB


Matthias Pantke from adscale said in a release that his company's online marketplace will begin offering real-time biddable impressions for its Germany-centric audience. Pantke says in a release, "We assume that at least 15 per cent of all Ad Impressions on adscale will already be traded via real-time bidding in 2012." adscale says 20 buying partners will participate on launch including Turn, MediaMath, DataXu, Struq, abilicom, adnetik, adnologies, ClickDistrict and plista. Pantke adds that he hopes to have all the "relevant national and international market partners" up and running by summer. Invite Media would seem to be one of them.

Private Exchange Deal


Casale Media's Andrew Casale says on The Makegood that using something he calls the "Deal ID" is the best way to get value out of private exchanges. He explains, "Just like each IO has a unique number, a Deal ID (deal identifier, in ad tech geeky speak) is a universal identifier that specific attributes for a campaign can be tied to. Deal ID is the parameter carried into every bid request a private exchange transmits to DSPs, indicating where a private deal is available to be activated." Consequently, Casale sees the buy and sell sides coming closer together.

Yahoo! CEO Drama


The "are you kidding me?" drama continues to unfold at Yahoo! around the details of CEO Scott Thompson's bio. He evidently claimed a computer science degree that he didn't have and this may bring down his short reign as CEO according to some pundits. All Things D's Kara Swisher thinks the sale of Yahoo!'s illiquid Asian assets may keep Thompson in his CEO job. She reasons that the flip-side - a CEO-less company - could scuttle a deal and "This is a sale that must - and I underscore must - get done and soon, giving Yahoo much-needed breathing room and a whole lot of cash to fork over to increasingly disgruntled shareholders."

If so, a lack of leverage could play into scuttling plans for a long-rumored sale of Right Media Exchange - or whatever plans Yahoo! has for the $680 million granddaddy of exchanges. 


Klout Ad Network?


Here comes another pixel. Tim Peterson covers the news on Adweek as social influence monitor Klout says that it will bring its +K button to the Web - not just Klout.com. Peterson explains the potential Web use case: "The +K button enables users to vouch for whether a Klout user should be considered influential on a given topic with a simple click of a mouse. So theoretically a Web-wide rollout would allow a brand or publisher to embed the button on their site and solicit visitors to rate them as influential on a given topic." Read more. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0017UMZZlY6sgeiZJalHpfiT6zNx1Cz61Kx2TQWGxlAcdZIBlU2kzSQbdn84KSc0PIxyafIGqr8_Th4_AMYxoVjBjuUriEXfUikNkurKbc1VivMuvz3FnoH6wZkOVJoU3VajYyRmMDzbEWJ0yFmoWmgHmLwEVgV8ECnr8JDBvnI43C-W_0H7IGFgQ==>  Hmmm.. I'd say that the Web-wide button could set Klout up for a more scalable ad network - assuming it will build one - rather than just using its own first-party, Klout.com cookies. It would extend the current, Klout "perks" ad model, too, where brands could buy Klout influencers beyond Klout.com and through exchange-like inventory sources and large publishers hooking into the +K cookie pool. Klout also could be the privacy solution of the future where the user WANTS to be cookied so that the user can better sell his/her value to advertisers and others who want to buy influence.


Big Fine


Bloomberg says that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is ready to take action against Google for going around Apple's Safari browser privacy settings and setting cookies. Bloomberg's Sara Forden reminds the reader, "Google signed a consent decree with the FTC last year in which it settled allegations it used deceptive tactics and violated its own privacy policies in introducing the Buzz social-networking service in 2010. (...)"

Platform, Plumbing, Publisher


In an opinion piece on Ad Age, the ubiquitous Ian Schafer of Deep Focus chastises those who classify Facebook as a publisher and think it should drive revenues similarly. He says it's a platform and writes, "Solely blaming Facebook for their inability to deliver advertising ROI, or enough metrics, is like blaming the school you went to for your salary not being high enough. Advertisers are in full control of the experiences they create on and off the platform."

Audience Thru Email


Aiming at driving up the value of a publisher's email subscribers, LiveIntent announced its new platform LFX. The company says DSPs, ad networks and the like can now bid on a list's audience. The release explains, "Campaigns can be targeted based on location, device, time of day and browser, as well as demographics including gender, age and household income. For even greater targeting sophistication, first and third party data can be used (...)." The email channel is steadily being unlocked for audience buying.

Facebook's IPO Movie

 
Sometimes there is required reading. And now, there is required viewing. If you haven't seen the video version of Facebook's IPO roadshow, it is something Martin Scorsese would be proud of as Facebook makes its case for being part of our lives. This is not your normal roadshow presentation as the company's CFO David Ebersman states at the very beginning. View it. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0017UMZZlY6sgd0oxFXgkYQPufuC9rGiRhP4FVinF0HVTY8__AO1TIu_xT0TAIehVEmukX7Cx4Y8FDF-_uFngi86C8Xo8LH5h9m-MyaHXgJ69DGOnnDqkc4OelKuRUwVOO8ceprqQxhiPh34GwQcwvRW2U46XKLCN3v3Kwe9ES_55U=>  Marketers will love this "film" and it's available in movie-quality resolution. To paraphrase CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the video, Facebook is building a platform so other people can build experiences. Warning to A.D.D. types - you're gonna need to set aside some time (30 minutes +1 minute for a Diageo case study) because you can't skip around - unless you'd like to use this version on YouTube <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0017UMZZlY6sgeqFIslkItQog9FDtm1rsXU1K9ptpww1_l0dBN5xuIAx92i2ovOA9tQJ6b6jg0SjJ3-Ru9LIKKZYj6eQp8IVFZ7hCQSh02MEBtjTvWQdY0hacTuAp5af_Qq895wI2p3FhvT0ktRVbCts84cwBlJmYyiTujQ8vRzJjGJWkGzxvdDGQ==> , which is at a slightly lower rez. 


Frienemies And Publishers


Noting the recent AdAudience partnership with Audience Science in Germany, and the imminent launch of Audience Square and AdMediaPremium in France, Maxifier COO Denise Colella sees the partnering going on between tech companies who are aggregating inventory as a net positive for publishers. She writes in AdMonsters, "These conflicts of interest will likely cause rival firms to adopt new means of differentiation while, at the same time, collaboration provides a means for publishers to compete more effectively and re-balance the equilibrium in the online advertising environment, which has swung too much away from them in recent years." What's also interesting is that there appears to be opportunity to create exchange-like companies in spite of the fact Google's exchange continues to grow, let alone other similar offerings such as Right Media Exchange or AppNexus. Unique, geographically-focused aggregation with scale echoes the continued value of vertical ad networks as buyers seek the right audience for their campaigns.

Alt:Attribution


On his company's blog, Simpli.fi CRO James Moore provides his Top 10 list on alternatives to "last touch" attribution. Topping the list among the alternatives: "The Talladega Nights Touch: The advertising vendor who serves the first impression gets full credit when the prospect converts. Why? Because this makes just as much sense as giving credit to the last vendor who touched the prospect. If you're not first, you're last."

Linking-In Presentations


Yesterday, LinkedIn announced the acquisition of SlideShare, a popular, shareable, slide presentation site for nearly $120 million. Linkedin CEO Jeff Weiner says in a release, "These presentations also enable professionals to discover new connections and gain the insights they need to become more productive and successful in their careers, aligning perfectly with LinkedIn's mission." That sounds nice. And they also get to extend their B2B audience network into a site with 29 million monthly uniques. And that's good for B2B audience segments which have inherently limited scale.

More Showrooming


A new study from Gfk says that more mobile shoppers are visiting the brick-and-mortar in an effort to see a product before they buy it online - a.k.a. "showrooming," From the study, "Among consumers with a smartphone or tablet, 50% used a mobile device to compare prices while shopping, 44% looked for a coupon, 33% "liked" a retailer on Facebook, and 17% bought a product using an app." Read about it. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001BkQrTYIqE3fFmRA2xKH8zDQ2tJJq3dCyQkGSGBgob4McXpgy_B7DFXV-PqCOQgVgoUZp8HsuE1W1utV5_zZ8Bgaj8qPVwAt2QY--3jNAvOA=>  


Real-Time M&A

You could say there's nothing ad-related here.. but in fact, we're talking about the efficient transfer of media.

A year ago, Cisco officials said that by 2015, there will be almost 15 billion network-connected devices in the world, with global Internet traffic quadrupling to 966 exabytes per year."

Rogue Sites


Do you know a rogue site? What is a rogue site, anyway? For the Association of National Advertisers and the agency organization the 4A's a rogue site is one that has content that infringes on intellectual property. They want marketers to make sure their ads don't appear on the "rogues" and provide them best practices.

Attribution Upgrade


In the wake of the "viewable impression" wave, Dentsu's IgnitionOne ad platform has updated its own attribution management capabilities.  According to the release, this update to the platform will "allow marketers to set up a secondary attribution profile that runs side-by-side with the primary profile that their media is being optimized against. This secondary profile will offer insights on how an alternate attribution profile would change how different channels are being credited and how that would affect optimization."

More On ValueClick


Citi's Mark Mahaney provides his take on ValueClick's recent earnings and offers some thoughts on the "Positive" side: "An in-lineish to modest bottom line beat quarter, 'tho partially benefited by a lower tax rate; 2) Greystripe Mobile business integrated into Valueclick Media as Mobile Revenue expected to double in contribution to roughly $40MM in 2012..." and he offers some "Negatives": "1) Unchanged 2012 guidance coupled with a top-line miss Q1 and lower Q2 outlook implies a more 2nd half loaded 2012. This increases VCLK's operational risk profile, especially as the company laps acquisitions; 2) Moderate softness in the Technology segment, only growing 7% Y/Y, despite easier comps.." Rating the company a "Neutral" as he notes "key risks": "1) Concern that VCLK's Media segment faces increased competition from Display Ad & Social Networks; 2) VLCK faces integration risk re: recent acquisitions; and 3) Comparison Shopping biz faces greater challenges as Google moves down the purchase funnel. On the other hand, valuation is reasonable and company has generally had a very solid execution track record."

The company was also challenged by a double dip recession in the UK and general economic malaise in Europe also served as a drag on what was otherwise a positive quarter..." (visit AdExchanger.com)

IBM Adds Another CMO Arrow


Adding another arrow to its CMO quiver, IBM announced the acquisition of Internet and mobile commerce analytics firm Tealeaf. Clearly, IBM can't get enough of understanding of behaviors online as it adds Tealeaf to previous, related acquisitions such as Unica (AdExchanger Q <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001vMG3lTCb-CepZiGgqibTzYLL1iljNGtuR5RgvH3oGHa-Ts4pDiDLF0wMvu0mWbBuw-0AHThrvoaMna2ThMzF-57FX2PRsx4KiARB_0py1Lkm5ZDShOeTYbvgfIkV_gsH81w9hyhoKGx4mhAFJ99vkiAh-YbX6BdX9WvheUQhpzGTAW-su1OaRg==> &A) and Coremetrics (AdExchanger Q <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001vMG3lTCb-CfwALsnhfwZ_l1ztyvSGbaVxq9brGHyBZp3abmKDJprtWqp46BWG_l9wk46iBJE_aA2mzTA6ax2pfNKFIqsVuhBuKjU95IItx75jozyU8WFMI9mxhH7jWUW5iqPg1R-6hKnUuIrvIqvUznpDSgdGXNT> &A).

Adconion And The Jobs Act


Reuters says that the recently passed Jobs Act may inspire a flood of new IPOs coming from Europe including, perhaps, ad network Adconion Media Group. Here's a bit of the skinny: "Lawyers and bankers preparing IPOs say that post-Jobs Act they are also seeing much broader interest, with non-tech companies in Benelux, the Nordics, Spain and Italy among those considering the United States. Any company with material business there and a strong growth profile could list in New York, bankers said."

Airlines And Sales


Upstream Group's Doug Weaver digs into his bag of acronyms and pulls out three FTAs (frequent traveler annoyances) - and then spins them into seller gold as he explains the deeper insight each FTA illustrates about sales organizations. FTA #1: "The On Board Announcements." Weaver insight: "Don't assume that simply because you're communicating that you're actually serving the customer."

Funds Of The Vungle


On All Things D, Peter Kafka reports on yet-another-new-round-of-funding, this time its a new video ads/app company called Vungle. Kafka explains the premise: "Vungle's pitch is straightforward: They help app developers make video promo reels for their stuff, and turn them into 'in-app' ads (you can see a sample below). There are a whole lot of ways to buy in-app advertising for other apps already - it's a big chunk of the mobile ad business right now - but the Vungle guys argue that they make it easy. And that unlike iAd, AdMob, Millenial, etc., it's all they do."

Local Display Ad Automation


On his Screenwerk blog, Greg Sterling reviews local display advertising and a new case study from PaperG (AdExchanger.com Q <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001vMG3lTCb-Cc9mYRExg0uZqTDIhD0k-eh3biB3EQLznv4u8iri7qA7ZKsoEIqD5-_ZDQP-kmyPkB5BduUA7CQA1U61uwu2kR8KS0I-nTvNroaMZizcYR-D-SqbCp1DwNBOAvIYSxTx92bqpdQLwE4lsEBOgodpZ6B> &A). During the piece, Sterling steps back and notes impressive results through automation, but also sees limitations: "This is one potential challenge I see with automated display ad creation: while the ads look good the landing page needs to be able to generate the conversion or other desired action. That involves at least some work on somebody's part - unless there's already a reasonable landing page from a past campaign or set up for lead capture."

Inside Facebook's Brittany Darwell covers the new Facebook API-infused ad plaform dubbed "BuyBuddy": "The updated platform allows Buddy Media tracks conversions off-Facebook and generates some of its own engagement metrics for the content brands share through the platform.

Discover-ing Twitter Ads


Former Google AdSense product guy and current Twitter vp of product, Satya Patel, makes an appearance on the Twitter blog. At first glance, it doesn't appear that he's introducing anything that could possibly be construed as advertising-related - but this is AdExchanger, so, let's go to the Twitter blog! Patel discusses the new  <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001rmkqLLHVLnzyiYpZyfPYD8rlEfFJ1T2Aszwdq6Kv8w-VSzGgV_ecnwaq19Mx9DVdu9b0TQbQRDq1ixrCzcp3yVu5pVkL9OWhXHnF28pOco2ZjsmBOnA_mZ4IxqJ9046uU5FMNhefypv7BvPILvZoRh-bvcKoOr8u4Wu-yliAldw=> "Discover" feature for the popular micro-blogging platform: "The Discover tab makes it easy to discover information that matters to you without having to follow additional accounts." Oh realllllly? (putting on AdExchanger conspiracy theorist, ad product hat) Looks to me that Twitter is pouring more traffic into hashtags and keywords that users would be interested in - thereby creating more scale for Twitter advertisers and better answering the question, "How can Twitter take better advantage of the contextual opportunity?" Sounds like AdSense to me! 


Data Science Shortage Follow-Up


Recent buzz around the shortage of data scientists in media has bubbled up in the news recently (WSJ (subscription), 4/30) <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001rmkqLLHVLnzwTyfeJGaOp1x49RLSs8cmnFCXT_95rhCqevSWWlYOvGuyZoIMKkA-gVugrhmJLslfVE-njwVLFdtbmQ017x0lS8hHo0xdTu9XF6CLbaSOkw1Im1vwPYRhjqDTnnCQU99klMbIF-YUNKjX4IsdWpK8heGRn0P8K01C8nmCwRYcMbvCaSNv7u0s> . In an email interview with AdExchanger, Turner's Ken Rona expressed some optimism if you're willing to do a little work. Rona said, "The hiring strategy that's working for us is to find really good analytic athletes and train them in media. The A players in analytics are by definition super smart, and they pick up the media business very fast." As for the top areas that Rona saw essential to address in media, he was unequivocal as finding an automated way to accurately classify their content. Rona saw some potential in the service or agency layer to address data science and make up for any shortfall: "CRM agencies are already springing up and others are exploring this idea. I think the ad tech stack is at a point where it's possible to assemble the components for an effective data sciences agency. I don't think they'll need to build all the technology. Some of the DSPs have capability in this area." Need more "talent pool" talk?

Video demand-side platform (DSP) TubeMogul has become so disgusted by all the fake pre-roll out there that it has started a site meant to expose the evil do'ers.

A TubeMogul spokesperson writes, "This site will showcase instances of brands' pre-roll video ads running in what we call 'fake pre-roll' ad units. We define 'fake pre-roll' as video ads that auto-play on a web page where the viewer has shown no intent to watch the ad or the content after the ad. They are typically run within banner ad units or in small, syndicated players below the fold."

Signs Point To Local


On GigaOm, Ryan Kim profiles a new, local marketing startup called Signpost which just raised a round of funding. He explains part of the pitch, "The company works with more than 1,200 publishers such as Google Offers, EveryDay Health and AOL Patch and places ads and deals on the sites that can be tracked back to clicks and purchases. The company has tried to position itself as an AdSense for local commerce with its one-stop shop approach."

Do Digital Upfronts Work?


GroupM chief investment officer Rino Scanzoni isn't sure what to make of digital upfronts according to Adweek's Mike Shields. Scanzoni says that Nielsen's Online Campaign rating may end up putting online over the top, but for now, there remains no standard measurement between TV and online that would make it easier for the marketer to buy. He says to Shields, "We can't tell a client, 'If you add X amount of dollars to Web video, you get Y.'"

The Tree And Display


Lending Tree reported its Q1 2012 results and beat estimates - 24 million in revenue on $4.4 million in net earnings. Citi analyst Mark Mahaney was impressed and commented on marketer traction and the display ad impact: "The company is seeing strong traffic to its sites from visitors looking for mortgages/refis, and is gaining traction with Marketers on its Non-Mortgage lead business; Display ad revenue leads were up 400% Y/Y, as the company revamped its Display biz; and Exchange Adjusted EBITDA was positive for the 4th quarter in a row."

Great White Private Exchange


Canadian media companies CBC/Radio-Canada, Rogers Media and Shaw Media announced that they'll partner on a private exchange for their non-guaranteed, display ad inventory. Known as CPAX - or Canadian Premium Audience Exchange for long - the new exchange will be powered by AppNexus and is scheduled to launch May 16. According to the release, CPAX will provide potential access to 15 million Canadians across more than 100 websites in both English and French. In response to an AdExchanger question about how the non-guaranteed will be handled once it has gone through the private exchange, an AppNexus spokesperson offered by email, "A tiered auction is the plan for now. Preferred buyers will be in the first tier, with preferential access. The impressions, if unsold, will be then available to a larger group of buyers." The private exchange offers "first look" -as well as a "first taste" of programmatic buying to big brand publishers. Read the release. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001RVA1kjT9hbVJTXH0PHShIfhFtnCOCsBmlSmdqGonQAiPC2aZlOPPgxzEuGdt0KgJkoeQE1GN204GUOmZ17WnLyGpE6PxYJ2SnKm-O-IISxWeIloOmO9yFqE9xKohGNeG9YvNJ6nrWbn8qezCD2_h6-Qt1a9XbWFdnnOoLB4XmjaqK1LYCS5siJIoFvZiePjU9ISrMoIxlRDSPMYmIHdfaao0do8i5VbCBKP9RzzVtxRLMCgTYg6ayNPhA2__1pzMpJw8O0VM5tTS2ot2GmTEgHSBnbmsY8-0t5KV7HzUDED92E5BrTvbUjKI-LbLYoAB>  


Funding The TV Ad Network


Former Tacoda and Real Media ad tech warrior Dave Morgan has reached out to existing investors for another round of funding for his targeted TV startup, Simulmedia. The soon-to-be-closed, $6 million inside round brings Simulmedia's grand, funding total to (drum roll) $27.25 million. Read more. <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001RVA1kjT9hbVego1LNb9Vy-AijdXlLbm14DM6QGrp0oopr9qOqgGlh-iIBYhs_EmWiutFrKnbIAcfgsY__jiKa0_OBRrD8bKiJb-w3yYCgNivDDHEleSqbMy1CU8SAbVSVDvaeCwfaMT64ZQQ4ZaWIvGOkqC4BHMkCxdHlD39piMfKAlA6RO6iPUeZ7JEuHe0nt0jKyqq9ptqum5-7_YIZA==>  From here, the funding flowing through ad technology right now is as fast and furious as ever. Interesting to see Morgan and Simulmedia formally take the wraps of his company's positioning as it's no longer just about optimizing TV tune-in <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001RVA1kjT9hbVBCJ3tOyblZoa_auMPREKHaN9U62yB0sGCaFjP_5CcYFi1VLpzJ-q-ysMFm8OgCOc-T11ODwS9mV2BjX_MCO3nYgvsPo4VgIsvqAG4qC2DRlW7RbjN85DsMi4ncgJqmqU=>  via set-top box data. From the boilerplate of the funding release: "Simulmedia, Inc. is a NYC -based television ad targeting company and operates the Simulmedia Audience Network, the world's first data-driven audience network for television." Integrated marketing for the convergently-inclined draws closer. 


Selling Display For Email


VentureBeat covers new email advertising inventory percolating in isocket's self-serve, reserved media marketplace. Email marketing SaaS company MailChimp is a key partner here as isocket CEO John Ramey tells VentureBeat: "The email functionality will be available through all email marketing platforms, but those that use MailChimp will have a more simplified experience. That's something that attracted lots of publishers to start using isocket in the first place." Read it <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001RVA1kjT9hbXhh4h07A18lYqW4y0f_BBIV38nZPy4w9REjfMzGAvPCaSk2ZYPRSZYc1Cdw-M_TCjckubV82QrTaPg03q6ArRPcwm0fBoO_X_9vP1d0Me9iDU5tGxMNPXdwaWB2dlfoPzxgIEJ3xqrCALxNUERqtEsuH6H930UrooCQzrPJX_5HQ==> . How long until this sort of inventory is bought programmatically, at scale, and includes other channels like the PC-based display and mobile Web? I'll guess 18-24 months. 


Social Foot Traffic


Data is driving media on Facebook. ClickZ's Christopher Heine who says that gift card distribution system Wrapp (which manages cards for Sephora, Gap, H&M, and others notes Heine) is letting retailers sync demographic and geographic data to make offers - and at varying price points. Heine notes the online/offline impact, "Wrapp's social commerce application is designed to help merchants increase foot traffic. The gift cards marketing system can also be employed for e-commerce."

Integrating The Ads


Digiday's Josh Sternberg profiles Complex Media Network which hails from a print publication background but has since morphed into an online ad network of sorts along the lines of Glam Media and Alloy Digital. It's combination of ads and content as Sternberg gets into the details, "Across the Complex Media Network, CPMs run between $13 and $17 on standard display depending on the category. It can go up from there if there's custom content, like video. CEO Antoniello says it has high CPMs because of its unique content. He explained that the company vets all of its publisher partners upon recruitment, so no linking strategies."

In that marketers increasingly want branded content/entertainment, clever online content owners may be able to make a lucrative match with brand dollars. Site rep firms rejoice!  Talented sales forces matter.

No Joy In Newsville


A.H. Belo reported its Q1 2012 revenue yesterday as the newspaper company (publisher of the Dallas Morning News among others) continues to take a hit and its print publication business evaporates. But, that's not all. It's digital revenue is apparently hurting, too. From the release, "Digital revenue decreased 11 percent to $7.8 million. Excluding the impact of a discontinuation of a revenue allocation to digital and the Super Bowl, digital revenue was flat in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the prior year period." Read the release <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001RVA1kjT9hbVq5YQZVEhP_YRn1R9GORH5p8qsMnre9LFQ-xM8cG5WhO3x12twxUPP5vOz2ArZvHO-xU9dZtVGOZ78Zjyno9Hs0n5nqD3JRSVozQg5HlJ6gk9kb3kfzVea3o87lmsg0m9gQmlGwBlsTa0wRMfECQDbhvk9sVntLOBEUOWPujxoc6jL09yyIVzvr8t8o454vUv74p6xPAkEMqcPw6gqjsXZ> . Local newspapers remain under siege. With so many access points for comprehensive news on the Web, the local newspaper's site finds it difficult to compete - especially with Craigslist grabbing its local listings business.
