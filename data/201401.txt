Amazon Q4 In


Although Amazon sales were up this holiday season as the company reported a 20% increase in revenue reaching $25.59 billion in Q4, the ecommerce giant still fell short of Wall Street estimates of $26.06 billion and shares plummeted 11% in after-hours trading. Amazon also announced it's considering tacking on $30-$40 to a standing $70-plus Prime membership fee, the first increase the popular service with free shipping perks has seen in nine years. This, naturally, colored analysts' questions on the Q4 earnings call. Although Amazon CFO Tom Szkutak acknowledged that tens of millions of "customers like the service and are using it a lot more," the company is planning a price increase to offset the cost of shipping and "provide lasting value for shareholders." Amazon, unsurprisingly, failed to detail any numbers on advertising services, which are grouped under "Other" revenues along with Amazon Web Services and cobranded credit cards. Notably, though, the "Other" category came in at $1.17 billion for the fourth quarter, a 52% increase from the $769 million recorded in 2012. How much of that $1.17 billion number is a result of advertising services is unclear, although eMarketer estimated they reached $835 million last year.

Ad Prognosis


Meredith Corp. is struggling with ad sales, both digitally and physically, the company revealed during its earnings call, according to WWD. "Calendar 2013 advertising performance was much stronger than calendar 2012, both for Meredith and for the industry in total. However, early calendar 2014 advertising appears to be off to a slow start. That said, industry experts are predicting full-year calendar 2014 magazine and digital advertising performance to resemble that experience in calendar 2013, the year just finished," said CEO Stephen Lacy.

In addition, CPMs and CPCs were both up year-over-year. Nanigans offered up some tips for the year ahead, saying, "To be successful in 2014, Facebook marketers must continue to embrace creative, targeting and optimization. In addition, retailers will continue to shift their focus to mobile users, consider video and invest in creative testing at scale."

TV Wars


Shazam is encroaching on social TV territory, aiming to take some of Twitter and Facebook's success for itself. With the Super Bowl coming up, the app developer hopes to lure users in by offering content feeds, and will appease advertisers by offering retargeting options through Facebook. "We have a lot of data that's a very strong signal of interest," CEO Rich Riley told Ad Age. "Leveraging that data to target advertising is a really big focus for 2014 on the ad side."

Not Dead Yet


BlueCava, which has seen the ups and downs of ad tech life, has successfully raised $13 million according to a press release <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001oHGN0haP3CkV1Btc-_fVmUdckU4yXwJHWnBlWyPqbCaQgfG49nFGMFvcDjRVbvJvKzacZousZquJDrFyl24qe1zLoYryuKF7wGfcAe5BVdFasSe_ugWcHtx9sMiXE8W6lj-KGIxGk0ZCxN8hkM0cnj1wsRRN3NOkCMlLgJfI1VE=> . Executive Chairman Phil Myers says, "This new round of capital will enable us to grow our business at the pace of the market that is opening up before us. (...) Our pipelines are healthy, and demand from customers to make 'cross-screen first' has intensified." BlueCava will apparently jump back into the market that Experian's AdTruth, Drawbridge, Tapad and others are aiming at. Next step is a CEO.

Namesake


Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was adamant from the inception of the social network that people have to use real names. That policy is changing for future apps, according to TechCrunch, as the site is going to ease up on username requirements. Although Zuckerberg believed using real names was a way of keeping people accountable and to ward off spamming, newcomers such as Snapchat have shown that the young audience prefers some level of anonymity. This shouldn't have any real effect on the bottom line seeing as ad targeting is probably very rarely done by name.

Programmatic And News


Programmatic takes the blame for sluggish ad sales in a Wall Street Journal piece about the potential glut of new news sites. The WSJ's William Launder writes, "One industry executive estimated that pricing on standard banner display ads has fallen 30% to 40% over the past several years, while an ad buyer said the prices on ads sold through automated platforms have dropped by as much as 70% over the past five years." Will online subscriptions - email or otherwise - save the day?

Patent Payout


According to Ars Technica, Google and its Adwords product have run afoul of the quixotic world of patents. Tiny Vringo has successfully won a decision for damages associated with the patents it acquired in 2011 from toothless search engine Lycos. Ars Technica's Joe Mullin explains the financial impact for GOOG: "An extremely rough calculation suggests US AdWords revenue is somewhere in the range of $15 billion to $18 billion annually. If that's right, it would place the Vringo royalty win somewhere in the realm of $200 million to $250 million annually."

Fraud Down, But Not Out


New data from Integral Ad Science says the fight against fraud is being fought effectively, but there are still gaps to fill. Forbes looks at the data and see that almost one in eight impressions are still fraudulent - though the good news is that "suspicious activity" is down from 30% to 13%. In spite of the continued success of fraudsters, publishers and advertisers may be turning a blind eye in order to meet their respective objectives - although both would benefit from a reduction in fraud.

Goodbye Direct Sales


Demand Media is shuttering its [direct] display sales and focusing on programmatic exclusively, following a similar move by Federated Media. "Our audience is ideal for this type of advertising. They come to our sites when they are ready to take action, and this move will facilitate advertisers reaching them at precisely that moment," said Shawn Colo, interim CEO of Demand Media.

AdChoice Awareness


Although the advertising industry is relying on self-regulation when it comes to privacy and data collection, the efforts don't extend far enough to the public, according to research from Parks Associates. In 2013 only 6% of respondents reported seeing the AdChoices icon, versus 5% in 2011. Parks Associates suggests deploying opt-in options rather than opt-out options, especially ones that include incentives such as personalized content or discounts.

Facebook Audiences


Facebook is expanding its Custom Audiences service to include retargeting off a pixel for both desktop and mobile apps. The company had previously been testing this feature, which is now live for all advertisers and it can be accessed through Power Editor, Ads Manager, PMDs and the API. Read the post <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001G08dgWaLv5CEGBOHTEUxKZTitrZg2oNNVdaUUPXQKsVqjM5P16x7O63LEkeryk_vh2gNZ2iEwb8uRfBQTvSKb2xrGW2ACkxHT6tSf9H-RZuZiRSNWkthH-XiMLhQtIsADQBG7sreS0QxN2lPDUQt_YLdsbB5c4IQz43TSjd3r1LWxAZ9MmqiCrygt3XBRrBiNkccmjNocqq1rjcWYl3s1AYWGRwwNz22OE2xjahbyNLyOwJsbefDlGlU_lMK-mzp> . An example from the post: "For instance, a travel website with the remarketing pixel could use Custom Audiences to reach a group of people - say, people that searched for flights but never made a reservation - with a targeted message in News Feed: Come back for 10% off your next flight reservation."

Addressing Privacy


In attempt to help its membership get ahead of the cookie/privacy landmines, the IAB released a new white paper called "Privacy and Tracking in a Post-Cookie World." For publishers, the IAB defines their needs in the cookie/privacy context as follows: "A single privacy dashboard; Comprehensive privacy controls; Significantly fewer third-party pixels; Improved user tracking and targeting; Reduced cost for privacy compliance; Ability to detect non-compliant third parties; Open competition; Minimal deployment overhead."

Local Mobile Ad Network Wars


On his Screenwerk blog, analyst Greg Sterling looks at what he sees as a battle among the local, mobile ad networks. He writes, "The way that location is evolving in mobile is more complex than most analysts and mobile ad forecasts portray. Straight-up forecasts that argue locally targeted inventory will be X% of all mobile ads are simplistic. Over time, location will be factored into more mobile advertising but its uses are diversifying."

Smartphone Domination


One billion smartphones were shipped worldwide in 2013, according to an IDC report, representing an increase of 38.4% over 2012. "Among the top trends driving smartphone growth are large-screen devices and low cost," said Ryan Reith, program director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. "Of the two, I have to say that low cost is the key difference maker."

Looking At Blinkx

 

There's something lurking beneath the surface at Blinkx and Ben Edelman seeks to uncover the truth about the company. He cites a number of instances in which Blinkx's properties installed malware or adware on computers and issues he had with Blinkx's site in which none of the videos listed could be accessed. Furthermore, he points out that only 23% of ads are viewable on Blinkx, according to Vindico.

Networking

 

MobSoc Media has a lot going on. It has raised $35 million in a Series A round of funding, and launched a network of 35 news sites that are mobile- and social-centric. The company gives advertisers the opportunity to target on four verticals: technology, lifestyle, sports and entertainment, with a focus on native advertising. MobSoc uses a ranking system to determine which stories will garner the most engagement.

CPGs On The Go


Consumer packaged-goods companies are taking on mobile as a way to connect with consumers directly and avoid waste through mass-marketing campaigns. So says Mobile Marketer, which claims brands can reach people through mobile who are already out shopping and are low in the shopping funnel.

Addressable Voting


Satellite TV competitors Dish and DirecTV are working together to bring addressable TV capabilities to political ads. The commercials will be targeted at the household level, according to Ad Age, and the combined audience is about 20 million households. "Political spending is a rapidly growing market and this allows us to go after new money," said VP Warren Schlichting of Dish Network. ZIP+4 targeting plays right into classic political targeting whether it's a precinct, ward, county or block. Overlay that with IP addresses and politicos hope for the holy grail of one-to-one communication with voters.

Viewability Come True


Horizon Media has tested a system that can detect whether an impression is in view before the ad is served. Viewability is hot! Horizon worked with Turn and RealVu to meet viewable standards while bidding programmatically, according to MediaPost. "We really don't see any value in bidding on inventory that's not in-view, we're trying to carve those impressions out and get it as close to 100% possible," said Donnie Williams, chief digital officer at Horizon.

System Updates


Acxiom announced additions to its Audience Operating System that give marketers more cross-channel abilities. Some of the new options include audience discovery by vertical, retargeting abilities of email audiences with display ads and real-time feeds. "We believe that the combination of Acxiom data, client data and third-party media data, applied in concert with AOS across channels, will help agencies and marketers generate results that redefine the evolution of 1:1 marketing at scale," said client Lisa Weinstein, president for global digital, data and analytics at Starcom MediaVest Group.

The Yahoo Display Report


Yahoo reports its Q4 2013 earnings today. In advance of the report, ABR Investment Strategy analyst Richard Fetyko said in a note to investors yesterday that Yahoo's display future remains foggy. "Display segment trends are less clear, particularly in light of the recent forced departure of the COO. Display revenue declined 7% in 3Q13, an improvement over the 11% respective declines in 1Q and 2Q, and we expect those improvements to continue." You can listen to the earnings webcast at 2 p.m. Pacific/5 p.m. Eastern on Yahoo's IR site <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001ma6VyrNncCzlZc4eLLrVyfxHKDEKSSh6iCRE4WWwOuaq-J7bVAF_Py1aV1i1VYV8E3G5htO8PodR68ipH9Aui3dvfjg25lYb3DgdEXlFOm4wtFW5k_jftp_uh2KixczUsKh9ouJ7Zlk=> .

Google Rides

 

According to TechCrunch, Google successfully filed a patent giving advertisers the ability to arrange free or discounted transportation to potential customers. Using an algorithm, Google would determine whether it made sense for the advertiser to offer the transportation to a potential consumer. One use case pointed out in the article would be for a casino on the Las Vegas Strip that wants to lure a potential visitor.

Ads Lagging Adoption

 

While mobile use in China continues to skyrocket, mobile advertising is still a tiny piece of advertising budgets, according to Ad Age. Two big players in the mobile space, Alibaba and Tencent, are both vying to be the de facto standard for mobile payments in the region. McKinsey & Co. estimates mobile will account for 3% of overall ad spend this year.

Publisher Hopes

 

SpinMedia, which is struggling financially, hired Piper Jaffray to try and turn the company around, the New York Post is reporting. CEO Dale Strang said he expects the company to be profitable this year, and CFO Scott Southron has apparently been telling partners that the company hopes to recapitalize soon. According to comScore, the number of unique visitors across SpinMedia's sites has fallen 22.3% in eight months.

Really Big Ads Best

 

A study conducted by Ipsos ASI, on behalf of Undertone, found that Internet browsers preferred large, full-screen takeover ads (a key Undertone product) over banner ads. According to Adweek, the larger ads were more likable and memorable. Native advertising wasn't included in the study so it's not clear whether people prefer traditional display ads over native ads.

Redirection Prevention

 

The Media Trust released a mobile scanner that will detect and prevent mobile redirects to other sites that may contain phishing scams and malware. The service works by scanning mobile Web pages, apps and ad tags around the clock. As The Media Trust points out in the blog post detailing this new service, users' patience with redirects is much lower on mobile, and having malicious redirects could turn the user off from the publisher altogether.

Startup Success

 

Adconion Direct CEO Kim Reed Perell is the subject of a glowing profile in Forbes. After living through the boom and bust of dot-com bubble years, Reed Perell started her own performance marketing company, which she sold to Adconion Media Group for $20 million. She attributes her success to building a profitable company from the ground up rather than relying on funding. "It always takes twice as long and twice as much money than you think it will," she said.

Online Payment Struggle

 

Mobile is working well for eBay and PayPal, but offline is a major headache for the companies right now, according to Mobile Commerce Daily. It's a struggle that eBay is going to continue working on as big retailers successfully merge brick-and-mortar stores with mobile. "PayPal in-store has gotten lost in the shuffle over NFC, iBeacon, Bluetooth low energy and anything else you can imagine," said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at Retail Systems Research. "I think the fundamental issue with mobile payments is that they're solving a problem consumers don't believe they have."

The Email In Retargeting


Self-serve retargeting platform AdRoll has made its second acquisition, this time scooping up email retention service Userfox. The acquisition gives advertisers the ability to collect and use email lists and mobile IDs. The companies did not disclose how much the deal cost. "Userfox stood out to us because they share AdRoll's vision of making complex marketing technology perform for a broad market," said Aaron Bell, AdRoll CEO.

Slow Boat To Cross-Screen


In a blog post this week, Microsoft Advertising GM Greg Nelson gives an update on data, user permissions and ad policies. When it comes to cross-device IDs, "caution" is the prevailing word, Nelson writes: "We could attempt to connect all the people who use our devices and services without their consent, and deliver the resulting scale (of potentially unengaged or dissatisfied consumers) to advertisers. But we choose not to do that." Also: Microsoft is simplifying ad formats and advancing plans for programmatic direct sales.

Marketing Content Automatically


Social media has opened up a new avenue for content marketing as brands struggle to find things to say to fans. NewsCred is one such startup and it has just raised $25 million, according to Re/code. NewsCred works with companies like Pepsi and Sprint to bring original and repurposed contents to visitors on their sites.

Mood Targeting


A patent filed by Apple shows the company's intention to serve users ads based on mood and behavior, according to Apple Insider. It seems the capability would best be used in a mobile setting due to the fact that Apple intends to use things like social media use and tone of voice as parameters. Privacy is also addressed in the patent, with Apple stating the information shouldn't be used for nefarious purposes. Feels so good <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=0013KmX48xbkeQ8N8Mqq9zfhc-FVKyGFEU0cY9tOyH5oa8gYQ6NckHjOYJRz3fLIK2w4kUULcAlceoTYTfKQBQ2NvdmXHWrjstxQ0ZarhRThFx2d3wrAcP-b9mmqf9e43cIBmUNjTbyaGNM3PK2xXU90PRdsYrqryIh6cEYf3PUgN0B6g6dYdWbsNwWBPfFN6v2GlRSvoERVJSIOyERyzJHxTit0sIbNaeb> .


Data Dilemmas


In the world of consumer sentiment as it pertains to data collection it appears that Amazon is trusted while sites like Facebook and Google are not. Ad Age speculates the difference could be in the language and services. For instance, with Amazon users give up their data in exchange for recommendations, whereas with Google and Facebook there is a feeling that these companies own the data and users see no value from that. The difference comes down to how users perceive the collection and use of their personal information.

Piracy Ads


Even with controls in place to varying degrees, "bad actor" publishers are still getting through. At Digiday, Jack Marshall notes that ad-tech companies are running retargeting ads that are sometimes ending up on piracy sites. He provides screenshots as proof. Marshall writes, "Ad tech companies should be aware that serving their ads on piracy-related sites implies either that they're happy to associate themselves with that content or that their tech is incapable of stopping it. Neither is a good look."

Rising Social CRM


Social CRM startup Intercom has raised $23 million, according to TechCrunch, as CRM evolves into a one-to-one marketing opportunity. "CRM companies haven't innovated in over ten years. Many of them are just ticketing systems. But what's happening is that customer service is at the leading edge of great competitive online businesses," CEO Eoghan McCabe said. The company has also hired a former PayPal and Yammer executive as its COO.

Promoting Pinterest


This will be the year photo-centric social platform Pinterest paves roads to monetization or, at least, that's what CEO Ben Silbermann is indicating. In a Q&A with the Wall Street Journal's Douglas MacMillan, the ex-Googler said "at a very high level, [advertisers are looking] to have their products or services discovered. We're still learning about the actual creative production process. Different advertisers have different abilities to actually create an ad that works well for this medium." The future of Pinterest, he predicts, is not purely transactional.

Programmatic Driving Diversity


A lack of diversity with ad creative is leading to higher costs and poor performance, according to a CPXi and AppNexus study <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001bARE1PYTPJq7Zqls_RGZf_rTmlsz_Mc-I7W_OBRpgGaXm1N2OiZuKJstUTYfMxnuxLOVnreWNScVpggoFdZrRoq0CEn9Ul4ci6PjOVXbJPw5g3ZUKrqHWqiqbARjgA0sDYOeaoqSXIMiHVzOkNsNTr5cepfgaeGi6a_RviprT3JoVXt_g6S1_86Fm_YNCsH1> . In some cases advertisers are paying more than four times what is necessary to achieve performance goals. The solution, according to the study, is leveraging diverse ad units and creative programmatically. "Programmatic creative can deliver higher engagement rates, lower cost and better overall performance. Further, it opens up the display market to smaller advertisers who have previously been limited by budget, as programmatic creative does not limit scale or accuracy only to those who can afford to develop a larger variety of creative assets," said Jeff Hirsch, CMO, CPXi.

Acquiring Analytics

Death of Brand Relationships?


The ultimate CMO of the future is the "ultimate customer relationship holder," writes Forrester's James McQuivey in a blog post <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001bARE1PYTPJqL2rUf3uX2pLlJU34ZIPw_z8pfkyxINwZvspZX1xm5PqblXDZGIxSxLZE9ZJEXl1uuHE6TuX41NYAox45B9vfVZb8EkVsrAHqFD3NaMoIIMvw4PxLbj5BXE5X4ZJBvI5TDvURviiqSZjkiOazrIGxFu1n0tTzitTm8dbhUdc11Ye-NzooBo94XYJmJqcYv1TnCWMj_i3bRptutVora8-kEIrFmY6d101a-rRfglxrTDzGEnC9cudHdJdn-tlkws5yoOQIIJVACoDSPrDyfJCWhz0Ihih2dCWw=> . According to McQuivey, "brand" relationships will become secondary -- or a byproduct of -- the digital customer relationship. He cites Starbucks' My Starbucks Reward program as an example, which, on the consumer end, equals points and cash rewards, but on the marketer's side, provides measurability.

AdSense Direct

 

Google rolled out Tuesday an AdSense feature allowing publishers to manage ads sold through direct channels. In a blog post <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001gjGD9V_af-UKaaY3uQDJ81mow_EeSsVV9SXcmGJYrFEts87l5p4pR12RE_EipCRq0nmdO7u4LNJZRsTrDVELmTAdGkLsl10NXOQvVC1vVDNhVRjWBHL8aphnuhi5Xpx4t3qfyf2rp9sdwoB0l1lHu7xHlH-X-tmfggpbUXqApwH8aRXaV4QEOneb5SU0NOtFAar5aQCb6X8=>  by AdSense Product Manager Matt Goodridge, Google explained the process: Publishers working directly with advertisers (regardless of whether those advertisers use AdWords) can enter terms of those deals into an AdSense account. Google will furnish publishers with links to send to advertisers, where the ad can be uploaded and paid for via Google Wallet. The product is restricted to the US for now.

Facebook: Text Doesn't Cut It

 

Are all text-based Facebook updates created equal? No, according to Facebook News Feed Product Manager Chris Turitzan. "The latest update to News Feed ranking treats text status updates from Pages as a different category to text status updates from friends," Turitzan writes in a blog post. "Page admins can expect a decrease in the distribution of their text status updates, but they may see some increases in engagement and distribution for other story types." By "other story types," Turitzan refers to more media-heavy updates, such as video, images or posts that leverage Facebook's Link Share tool.

Interpublic Group's (IPG) London-based advertising agency, Lowe and Partners, has acquired digital agency Profero. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Beyond Auctions

 

Amazon and eBay may differ fundamentally, one being an ecommerce marketplace and the other an ecommerce auction site, but mobile may align the two more closely, according to Mobile Commerce Daily. A report from Macquarie Capital revealed eBay is working on a direct-to-consumer service called The Plaza, giving brands an opportunity to sell outside of the auction environment. "Mobile is a place they are very comfortable with and their popular commerce-enabled app means they can leverage location-based functionality for push messaging, real-time customized discounts, etc. in a way the competition might find hard to match," said Wilson Kerr, vice president of business development and sales at Unbound Commerce.

Twitter's TV Push

 

You don't need a crystal ball to tell you that Twitter is angling to hitch its data and analytics to TV advertisers' budgets as the go-to for second-screen engagement. After all, Twitter did acquire social TV insights provider BlueFin more than a year ago and it's also working with Nielsen to add its knowledge of how its users' chatter impacts TV ratings. Adweek's Garett Sloane talked to a bunch of CES ad-industry attendees -- mostly on background -- about their excitement at Twitter being ready for prime time. "New insights around television-watching behaviors and simultaneous media consumption are making multiscreen strategies an imperative for brands," said David Rittenhouse, Neo@Ogilvy's managing director.

Twitter Targets Demographic Groups


In addition to video, Twitter is also ramping up its pursuit of demographic groups. Before it went public, Twitter rarely drew attention to its racially diverse user base. Things have changed. "Now, as a newly minted public company needing to generate revenue, it is moving to capitalize on its demographics," writes The Wall Street Journal's Koree Koh. Twitter tapped marketing veteran Nuria Santamaria for a new position as multicultural strategist, Koh reports, leading the company's efforts to target black, Hispanic and Asian-American users.

Though the terms of the acquisition were undisclosed, Accenture will gain access to ClientHouse's sales and services businesses, which brings products like the Salesforce.com Sales and Marketing Clouds, QlikView business intelligence and Veeva CRM to end customers.

Mobile Ad Market Growth Slowing?


Gartner released a report anticipating a slowdown in mobile ad-market growth due to the basics of supply and demand. The research shop predicts from 2015 to 2017, more mobile ad inventory will be available than is needed. Despite this, the report expects global mobile ad growth to be strong, expected to increase from $13.1 billion in 2013 to $18 billion this year. And by 2017, Gartner projects a mobile ad market of $41.9 billion. In terms of format, video will grow the most due to the proliferation of tablets, though display will continue to make the most revenue.

Growing In South Africa


Publicis Groupe is taking a stronger hold of the promising South African advertising market with its announced acquisition of top-10 South African media agency Applied Media Logic (AML). AML will be aligned Publicis' ZenithOptimedia global media unit and will be branded ZenithOptimedia South Africa. AML Managing Director Kim Weissensee will be appointed the rebranded unit's CEO. It makes sense that Publicis would dive in, as ZenithOptimedia has identified South Africa as the eighth fastest-growing advertising market between 2013 and 2016.

Future Media Agency


Mediabrands CEO Matt Seiler wants to prove media agencies don't have to fall behind the curve when it comes to innovation by taking his company firmly into the automated, digital age. A profile in Adweek outlines how Seiler has advocated for a pay-per-performance model and collapsed P&Ls. "Matt's not a media dork or specialist," said Jay Sears, SVP for marketing development at Rubicon Project. "Because of that, he brings Mediabrands buying to the cool kids table. Automation brings efficiencies to the salt mines. As an account guy, Matt is still client-focused and can explain automation to clients in the plain English they understand."

Smarter TVs


The primary use for smart TVs right now may be simple things like streaming Netflix, but Panasonic believes the future holds much more for these devices. With cloud computing advances, we'll see gaming on TV along with much more robust Web browsing and content discovery, according to VentureBeat.

Slicker ad-messaging options are bound to go along with those advances.


Reshaping Brands


JPMorgan Chase has a new CMO, Kristin Lemkau, who has worked for the company in different capacities for some time, according to Ad Age. "The thing I'm most proud of there was repositioning and rebranding JPMorgan," Lemkau said. "At the time, we had a lot of brand confusion and messiness. We worked hard to build out the brand value propositions and identities of JPMorgan and Chase separately."

Valuations


Boutique investment bank LUMA Partners sees SaaS and programmatic driving company valuations in the next couple of years. LUMA chief Terence Kawaja concludes in an opinion piece on Re/code, "We are likely to see several programmatic companies pursue the public market over the next 24 months. Not all candidates have pure-play models. The market will need to assess each of these business models and the companies' respective roles in the ecosystem in order to determine their appropriate valuations."

Native Deceptions


Native advertising, formerly known as advertorial, has attracted the attention of the FTC, which is concerned about adequate disclosure. Kirk Cheyfitz, CEO and chief editorial officer of Story Worldwide, believes publishers shouldn't bet on native ads sticking around -- and not only because of regulators. He writes in a column for PandoDaily that as more channels open up for brands to express themselves without the need for publishers, the reliance on native advertising will drop.

Programmatic Direct

 

On eMarketer, Xaxis COO Dr. Mark Grether answers a question about percentage of ad spending going to programmatic direct vs. RTB. Grether tells eMarketer: "It really depends. I don't have a number for the US, but I do have a number for Europe, which is about 70% or so [of total programmatic ad spending] that's actually programmatic-direct. The number is likely smaller in the US, but basically, I think that's about where it will end up."

Bad Ads Up And Down

 

Google says that more ads were pulled in 2013 but that there were fewer bad advertisers. Good news? Google ads engineer Mike Hochberg offers a perspective on the Inside AdWords blog: "We removed more than 350 million bad ads from our systems in 2013. To put that in perspective, if someone looked at each of these for one second, it would take them more than 10 years to see them all. This was a significant increase from approximately 220 million ads removed in 2012. This trend has been consistent in the last several years and we attribute it to several factors, including: the growth of online advertising overall and constant improvement of our detection systems."

Social TV Struggles

 

Twitter has been pushing its Amplify program to video advertisers, but the adoption is low because of Twitter's limited reach, according to Rory Maher, who was cited in a Barrons article. Most TV advertisers prefer a threshold of 100 million viewers, whereas Twitter has about 53 million monthly active users. Facebook, which has the users, is also struggling to attract video ad dollars due to its weak relationship with real-time TV viewing conversations.

UK Momentum

 

In Digiday, Jack Marshall reports on UK programmatic momentum with the help of Rubicon Project's Jay Stevens. Marshall reports, "The U.K. market's smaller size might make it better placed to capitalize on the efficiencies provided by programmatic ad buying, but the fact remains that average insertion orders are much smaller than in the U.S. Everything's relative, of course, but there's simply less ad revenue to be tapped in the U.K., and it's harder to extract from the market."

Counting Connections

 

Appliances are becoming smarter and in turn are amassing data about user preferences that can be capitalized on by marketers. But, warns Christopher Hansen, president at Netmining, "Let's stop looking for ways to shove advertising in consumers' faces simply because there is a rise in connected devices. ... There may be ad opportunities, but it won't come in the form of banners or text ads, and it will likely be a different execution for every vertical."

Getting Personalized

 

One-to-one marketing is a huge goal in the data-driven advertising world, and Evocalize is helping businesses connect with customers personally. The SaaS company just raised $3 million in Series A funding, according to a press release, which was led by Madrona Venture Group. "Evocalize gives us a way to open a dialogue with our core customers in a conversational way that's less intrusive than a standard survey and that's easily managed on our end. It's like a focus group on a massive scale," said Buffalo Wings & Rings Marketing Manager Charlie Francus.

Funding Automation

 

Marketing automation company Salesfusion raised $8.25 million in a round of funding, according to VentureBeat, while others in its competitive set are being acquired or going public.

Mobile's Different In China

 

China has more Internet users than the US has people, and 81% of that Internet population is on mobile, according to The Next Web. Microblogging users have dwindled in the country, the number of instant message users is shooting up, which is great for services like WeChat, but it could be worrisome for Twitter-like services.

That's The Spirit

 

To keep the entrepreneurial spirit alive, Deutsch L.A. is allowing employees to create pitches for ideas that would then be backed by agency resources if approved, according to The New York Times. The effort could keep performing employees from venturing out to create separate companies. "We're getting insights from the executives and partners here at Deutsch," said David Plafchan, a senior copywriter at Deutsch L.A. "Seeing the higher-ups pulling for you, excited for you, believing in you, that's a cool thing."

Yahoo Has Room, Needs Board

 

The Wall Street Journal ruminates on possible replacements for two directors at Yahoo. The WSJ's Joann Lublin and Douglas MacMillan write, "For its current hunt, Yahoo prefers that both new board members be seasoned CEOs, with at least one having international operating experience, the person familiar with the situation said. Those picks represent another way for Ms. Mayer to cement her turnaround strategy."

It's Not Over


AOL is handing its local news platform, Patch, off to investment holding company Hale Global. Although it will be a joint venture, Hale Global will assume the risk. Read the release <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001f70i2JT3QiGsvYXNDxZawjoSaKa5bduqYLkFDgPHxDVSsOKIk2N48PZTcdHQIE_VEFkmI3OORTTbt8h0pcsQF_EipL38p89CAF2zYWoltMTvWWBEQ9Ok6LOLuS9_xg4ptSdMxZThhQODp3BenS8EfsmmBJ7FHGnRQTLFpwz8vMHTbwgb1f9xgQR5gsTtjaGkbxf_mcA3Zxq_Jm2tTEZJ6Q==> . The companies maintain that all Patch sites will remain open, but it seems they are going to take a broader view of coverage, according to Re/code. In a memo to AOL employees, CEO Tim Armstrong wrote, "AOL has delivered on our commitment to our investors and put Patch in a position to be successful. We are retaining a meaningful minority interest in the joint venture, and we stand to benefit from Patch's pivot to platform excellence."

Banking On Email


LiveIntent has raised $20 million in Series C funding to ramp up its real-time bidding platform for email, bringing its total funding to $32 million. The company, which works with brands like Kraft and Chrysler, as well as Hearst and The Weather Channel on the publisher side, reaches more than 55 million consumers each month, the company claims. The programmatic inbox is alive and well.

The practice of advertising has gotten a bad rap, Doug Weaver, CEO and founder of Upstream Group, points out in a post on his blog, yet it's a necessary part of the larger marketing picture. Weaver recommends that when advertisers go to sell their product they look at it from the client's side, rather than from a simple buy-sell point of view.

The Engagement Factor


Facebook seems to drive the results that agencies crave, according to a new comScore study. The results showed that automotive campaigns on the site drove visits to brand sites, increased brand searches and decreased competitive brand searches.

Trading Future


The Trade Desk's Jeff Green envisions a programmatic future, in which everything is done in real time, possibly even print ads. In an interview with Business Insider, Green talks about the growth of programmatic and how it will affect multiple sectors including presidential elections. "The world we're evolving toward is one where people are more involved, not less involved. When you get a world with more data and more insight, you need more people to analyse it. You need more people to make decisions," Green said.

Local Nuances


"Programmatic" created scale for local advertising, according to Eli Portnoy, GM of Thinknear, in an interview with Street Fight. Context is important to location-based targeting because it all depends on what's top of mind for the consumer. Portnoy also points out that because mobile transactions are still low, there is a push to drive consumers to purchase in a store, or to buy later.

SapientNitro Buys Cross-Cultural


Two years after buying a string of data-focused firms (Iota, Second Story) and then hitting "pause" on M&A, SapientNitro is back at it. The digital agency has scooped up La Comunidad, a Hispanic-focused creative shop with offices in Miami and Buenos Aires, for an undisclosed sum. The deal is reminiscent of Sapient's 2009 acquisition of "above-the-line" agency Nitro - noteworthy for being the first (to date, only?) major attempt by a digital marketing services company to absorb a traditional agency business. Says a SapientNitro rep, "Since acquiring Nitro [in 2009] we've been buying and connecting different sets of capabilities -- data, analytics, experience."

Ringing Analytics


Phone calls can be an important tactic in marketing, but CMOs may not be aware of the opportunity to measure and optimize that channel. That's the premise with Invoca, a call marketing company, which just raised $20 million in a round led by Accel Partners. The company focuses on tracking and analytics and integrates with major CRM companies.

Programmatic Publishers


A new role has emerged for publisher ad teams centered around the exploding growth of programmatic buying and selling. As Digiday points out, the roles typically revolve around training sales staff, managing a tech stack and working with new advertisers. "You have to prep your team to understand how to integrate it [i.e., programmatic] into any sale," Chip Schneck, Meredith's VP of programmatic sales and strategy, told Digiday. "A key part of my role is scaling, which is getting people talking about it with clients and understanding how it can support a deal."

About That Email


Experian Marketing Services said a release yesterday that it had a record-breaking year for "Holiday Email Volume, Transactions And Revenue." EMS GM Peter DeNunzio noted, "Traditionally, as email volume increases, performance decreases, but in the 2013 holiday season we saw the opposite. An increase in total transactions and revenue tells us that leading marketers have found their stride, sending more relevant emails to each customer based on his or her unique needs."

The Digital Future


The outlook on agencies isn't too bright, according to a survey conducted by RSW/US, which polled 320 marketing and agency leaders. As Adweek points out, a lot of participants felt the future of agencies hinged on their ability to go digital and more flexible.

Agency Refresh


XL Marketing has been rebranded intro Zeta Interactive, which co-founder and chairman David Steinberg says points to the marketing solutions and services company's evolving CRM business. After acquiring Adchemy's Actions division and performance marketing company Intela, "we realized our brand needs to better reflect who we are and how our clients view us," Steinberg stated.

Programmatic Brands


It's not just the year of programmatic, it's the year of programmatic branding, according to RocketFuel's Richard Frankel and Martini Media's Skip Brand. As Brand points out in a column on MediaPost, scale is crucial to the adoption of programmatic, and so is a transition from belief-driven to data-driven. Frankel also predicts that pre-roll video will gain a little steam this year.

Social Changes


Facebook is changing up its newsfeed algorithm to focus more on outside link and news items, according to new Blinq Media CEO Luis Caballero in Ad Age. He says this will inevitably change the way marketers interact with consumers on the platform as organic reach continues its decline.

Location Panel


The WSJ profiles Turnstyle Solutions, a year-old "local" company that installs device-tracking sensors in about 200 Toronto businesses. "The sensors, each about the size of a deck of cards, follow signals emitted from Wi-Fi-enabled smartphones. That allows them to create portraits of roughly 2 million people's habits as they have gone about their daily lives, traveling from yoga studios to restaurants, to coffee shops, sports stadiums, hotels and nightclubs." This location data can be molded into anonymized profiles of a participating shop's customers and their shopping patterns.

StubHub decided to cut out the middle man and build its own programmatic tech stack, as Digiday points out, which has led to more efficiency and cost savings.

StubHub was already handling its own search ads, so it naturally progressed into handling its own display as well.

DMP Troubles

 

Buried halfway through a feature on the state of iCrossing, Adweek's Chris Heine notes the search-centric agency has had a tough time extracting value from the DMP it bought in 2011. Depending on whom you ask, Red Aril (renamed Core Audience) 2011 is either an "empty shell" or "a huge part of our go-forth strategy."

The Native Year, Again

 

Native advertising was a hot buzzword in 2013, and Kunal Gupta, CEO of Polar, predicts in a column for Mobile Commerce Daily that its only going to heat up in 2014. Social companies have already based a lot of their ad model on native, especially since it performs so well on mobile. Publishers are starting to follow suit, and companies like BuzzFeed and Quartz are reaping the benefits of this new ad format.

Mobilizing Yahoo


Marissa Mayer's vision from a mobile-centric Yahoo is coming to fruition through its series of acqui-hires and app development. As VentureBeat reported, half of Yahoo's users are already on mobile, and its products, such as Mail and Weather, have been reinvented for the mobile age. Yahoo's recent acquisition of Aviate is all part of Mayer's vision for the mobile future. "We are convinced that the nature of search is changing, and what's happening on mobile devices - using context, anticipatory computing - is where we see [contextual mobile app launcher] Aviate going," said Yahoo mobile SVP Adam Cahan.

Where do ads fit in the Yahoo mobile future? The jury is still out.


Testing Automation


The increasing mobile nature of social media has led companies like Twitter and Facebook to rethink how they develop and test their apps. Facebook in particular has decided to build out Airlock <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=00107VHVOMNy6z_W7WHH74JT34Y5TmmerIZ8Q0hz0O_XEoqCObRqMs_pjkwNqZGpcQdmmAK33z12QzZUlJiHyJXtDhmRtpj_Ivs0h1_dnW3xNWk2VYgbmYBeJq-gv4-NzePsx7YLiE0leu7KZY_ndd0klT5yzkF8CQGnQxeyVNsVysBlCzb8Sg0Sj7THL573XC8bB8KHt-vkPlkoL5SNIuJTkTvQZag0P4F> , allowing it to A/B test different iterations of its mobile app. A blog post goes into detail about how exactly this all works, but as TechCrunch <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=00107VHVOMNy6z3T0a2u8LPKe32zkYu4MhBJ7W-ScLMsQlX6MzhJMe5lHjEBWyFF5OUewp_blUmaugQPkmM66kATL8BDFerzPokvzZzHqLvNj8FuitIKk4agbZngjQWk3jrI5h8DiVvbqCc7O7yb-WL57A9fibskbEkWFO6eFuYJ0Q=>  points out it will improve user experience.


Preferable Paywall


On the Nieman Journalism Lab blog, Ken Doctor compares and contrasts newspaper giants The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal ability to overcome adversity brought on by Digital. He notes, "Advertising still represents a majority of revenues for the Journal, sources say, in the mid-50s percentagewise, with circulation in the mid-40s. That's the inverse of the Times, which recently reported that 56 percent of its revenues now come from readers. Given that reader revenue is now growing as paywalls have gone up, and that print ads remain in sharp decline, majority reader revenue seems to be the preferable market position."

Consumer Marketing


More CMOs are focusing on the consumer, according to Andrew Frank, research VP at Gartner. Citing a study conducted by The Economist, the percentage of CMOs whose companies focused on customer intimacy increased from 21% to 37%. Consumers are becoming more aware of privacy issues online, which could cause them to guard their data a little more in the future.

Ad Tech Crystal Ball


Mike Kisseberth, CEO at TechMedia Network, is predicting changes to both native and programmatic advertising, including the possible intersection of the two. In a post on folio, Kisseberth points out that a huge pain point for native right now is scale, but as that changes the ads will get more data-driven and regulated. For programmatic, media buyers will become more tech-savvy, and premium and direct will be more prevelant.

Tracking Facebook


A Facebook PMD, ShopIgniter is looking to bridge the social site with the mobile Web, according to Inside Facebook. The company uses a Web landing page with a URL tag to track conversions, which is then used to create a Facebook ad. Right now many Web landing pages are not optimized for that level of analytics.

The Internet is endless, but Web pages aren't, though that will likely change, as Digiday points out. Sites like Quartz, and even some Yahoo properties, have broken ground in providing an endless stream of content that mirrors users' habits with social media. The only hangup is figuring out advertising on the new Web, as advertisers are used to metrics such as clicks and impressions instead of engagement.

Open TV


Simulmedia is offering two new tools, Plan and Report, to offer advertisers a glimpse into targeted TV advertising. Plan gives estimates on the size of a TV audience and Report is a campaign-measurement tool. "We are always hearing interest in benchmarks," Dave Morgan, chief executive officer of Simulmedia, told MediaPost at the time. "It's not guesswork any more."

The New CMO

Social Bots Link-In

 

Bots don't just haunt display advertising, they're creating problems for social sites too, forcing LinkedIn to take legal action, according to GigaOM. The company's competitors use the bots to scrape information from user profiles, but there it's not clear what risk this behavior might be to users. "We're a members-first organization and we feel we have a responsibility to protect the control that our members have over the information they put on LinkedIn," the company said in an email.

The Data Year

 

The 2014 predictions continue rolling in, and James Moore, CRO of Simpli.fi, foresees 2014 being the year data increases in value to marketers. His arguments center around the increasing RTB inventory, cross-device targeting capabilities and the move toward unstructured data. In his opinion, programmatic is going to allow marketers and advertisers to unlock the full potential of their audience data.

The P Word

 

The advertising industry is full of jargon and acronyms, but one that especially bothers Doug Weaver, founder and CEO of Upstream Group, is "partner." In a post on his blog he points out that it seems the industry is self conscious about using terms like "seller," "vendor" and "supplier" to describe relationships, and would rather use a blanket term like "partner."

Another P word, blanket term, favorite: "platform."

 

Ad Rules

 

The Weather Channel broke some rules and put an auto-play longer than 10 seconds on Twitter through Amplify, according to Adweek. Twitter hasn't yet commented about whether it will pull the ad. Facebook has been experimenting with autoplay ads in user's news feeds that are 15 seconds long.

Small-Town Tweeting

 

Not to be outdone by other social networks, Twitter is strengthening its local advertising ability with a new feature called Nearby, Digiday reports. The map feature shows users what others are tweeting about in their vicinity. This could open up a host of advertising options from local businesses and even national chains with a local presence, such as Macy's or Starbucks. "Nearby sends a stronger signal versus Foursquare," said Dirk Rients, director of mobile at DDB. "With a tweet, there's more context. It's more than just location; you can tie location to the mood of the user."

Microsoft has acquired customer service SaaS Parature for $100 million, which will add to its CRM platform. According to TechCrunch, the new acquisition will allow Microsoft to communicate with customers through multiple channels at the same scale as a complex call center. One area that is still lacking is commerce, according to Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research.

Nontraditional Display

 

In PandoDaily, Infolinks CEO (and former Blue Lithium and Yahoo exec) Dave Zinman weaves a story about his company's tech and its "take" on the display ad. Zinman uses a consumer survey his company undertook, and Pando's Cale Guthrie Weissman writes, "In short, the survey found that non-traditionally placed ads - those that aren't in the usual 'ad banner' spaces of above or to the side of websites - performed much better than traditional ones. Further, it found that people just didn't like traditional ads."

Yodle is taking marketing automation to the local level with its new Centermark product, according to Screenwerk. "The platform provides a source of shared data, communication and reporting that facilitates informed conversations between all the partners on the network," the company told Greg Sterling.

The Loyalty Factor

 

Nielsen is going beyond basic TV ratings by tracking loyalty to networks as well, according to Ad Age. The first study it conducted included 75 cable entertainment networks and the results showed that USA Network came in first place, with Bravo close behind. However, TBS ranked fifth out of 75, despite the fact that it is poised to have the No. 1 ratings slot. "This is not a replacement for ratings, but a compliment [sic] to better assess the quality of the environment," said David Kaplan, VP for research at Bravo.

When Malware Strikes

 

Malware was delivered to consumers via a display ad in several European countries, according to multiple reports. NBC aggregates the news and says that, according to one source, "9 percent of visitors to the malicious site through a Yahoo! ad were infected by the malware, which is about 27,000 infections per hour. The first sign of infection dates back to Dec. 30." Romania, Great Britain and France were apparently most affected.

The New Radio

 

Pandora launched its first in-car ads, according to Adweek, and has signed deals with BP, Ford, State Farm and Taco Bell. Pandora has been aggressive about getting its streaming radio service into cars and is now available in nine of the top 10 selling cars. "We are now seizing the opportunity to connect advertisers with a more targeted audience than traditional radio can provide," said Pandora's chief marketing officer, Simon Fleming-Wood.

When Facebook Went 'Nonsocial'

 

Buried in a Sunday WSJ story on Mark Zuckerberg's evolution as a media executive is a description of his eventual embrace of "nonsocial ads" such as retargeting placements and CRM matching. "At the time, it kind of struck me as a crazy idea," Zuckerberg said, because it seemed to depart from his early vision of enabling word-of-mouth marketing at scale. The rest is history.

CNN Shakeup

 

CNN President Jeff Zucker and his platform-agnostic view may usher CNN into the digital age, a feature in Ad Age points out. One change Zucker intends to make in 2014 is to tailor videos for the Web and mobile instead of repurposing TV airings. Advertisers still need convincing, though, as some have pulled their ads from the network, citing better CPM rates from Fox and MSNBC. "We never want to give up on breaking news. But the types of programs we do offer will be broader -- informational, educational, entertaining. You will see more of that next year, allowing us to broaden the audience and field to advertisers," Zucker said.

Intel's TV Dreams Doused

 

Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich says in an interview with Re/code's Ina Fried that Intel gave up on its Internet TV service because the technology was there, but the content wasn't. "You could have the biggest screen, you could have the clearest screen. But if there is not great content on this thing, that big-screen TV is not a huge value to you, even though it has the best picture on the planet," Krzanich said.

Native Times

 

The New York Times is planning a redesign that will launch Wednesday to make way for its new native ad content, according to Adweek. The ads will only appear on the desktop site for now, and will be labeled as "Paid Posts" and have a blue border to differentiate them. There has been some contention over native advertising, especially the the confusion it could create for readers.

The Data War

 

When it comes to data, first-party is the best, but there is no shortage of companies willing to sell third-party data for a high price. Paul Rostkowski criticizes the practice on Ad Age, given that so little of the third-party data may actually be useful. If marketers aren't diligent about testing the data they could end up wasting a lot of money. Not to mention first-party data is free along with other basic information such as geography and URL domains.

The Rise Of Mobile

 

LinkedIn Marketing Solutions aggregates mobile ad spend data in an article on Mashable. Mobile ad spend nearly tripled from 2012 to 2013, going from $1.2 billion to $3 billion.

The News Of Weather

 

The Weather Channel is no longer just a utility, it's a media company, under the financial auspices of NBCUniversal, Blackstone and Bain Capital. As the New Republic points out, the company not only increased the amount of original journalism on the site, it has also begun naming winter storms, giving it a social media edge. "We are absolutely all about information dissemination during severe weather," said a spokesperson, "but we also have tons of amazing content for when the weather is 70 and sunny." And that means more clicks.

The company last month acquired a patent for ad blocking, which sounds counterintuitive for an ad-tech company.

Publication Reboot

 

AllThingsD is no more, but two of the minds behind it, Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, have launched a new publication called Re/code. The site falls under the Revere Digital company, with NBCUniversal News Group and Windsor Media as investors and partners. The company will continue to produce events as well as operating news sites and apps.

Shifting Consumption

 

Millennial men are flocking to the Internet for news consumption and leaving magazine publications such as GQ and Maxim behind. This wave of bro media, as Digiday referred to it, is attracting large advertiser dollars despite risks to brand safety. "You don't sell skinny jeans in Disneyland," said Solly Solomou, founder of UK-based TheLadBible.com. "You have to be naive to say brands aren't going to connect themselves with this type of content if that's where their audience is."

India-based digital CRM company Vizury dipped into the venture well with a $20 million raise. Vizury CEO Chetan Kulkarni tells TechCrunch, "We'll invest in building local products for markets like China, because that's the only way it can become a billion-dollar market."

Preempting Privacy

 

If marketers aren't proactive about data collection and privacy, it could end up costing them in the end, according to Ad Age. Although consumers ask for more relevant ads, argues Jonathan Salem Baskin, it doesn't mean they are willing to give away all of their personal information for free. As organizations like the Federal Trade Commission start making the issue more public, consumers will likely become more diligent about the data they share.

Record Highs For Ad Revenue

 

While you/we were away, a report from the IAB and Pricewaterhouse Coopers revealed that Q3 Internet ad revenues hit a high of $10.69 billion. "These figures reflect marketers' trust in interactive to deliver," said Randall Rothenberg, president and CEO of IAB. "It is indicative of the digital age in which we live, and within which advertisers need to effectively reach targeted audiences wherever they are consuming information or entertainment - often on several screens at once."

Sony is selling its Gracenote business to Tribune Co. for $170 million, according to Bloomberg, as it tries to streamline its business. The software is mainly used by companies like Apple and Amazon as a recognition service, but could be used to serve targeted ads on TVs. "Together we will become an even greater force in the global entertainment data business," Shashi Seth, president of Tribune Digital Ventures, said in the statement.

China Deal

 

Apple has finally made a deal with the largest Chinese mobile carrier, China Mobile, that could potentially bring millions of new customers to the tech company. The Next Web reported that there could be some overhyping going on, though, as there are other networks in the country that carry iPhones. Add to that a high sticker price and it could be that Apple doesn't scoop up quite as many users as it hoped.

Funding Answers

 

Answers.com is on an upswing, raising $300 million and acquiring customer experience analytics company ForeSee, according to TechCrunch. The site relies on subscriptions for half of its revenue. The company hopes that by providing its Q&A service on other sites it can build a more dynamic platform as similar sites, such as Yahoo Answers, continue to lose popularity.

Publishers' Hall Of Shame

 

Publishers who use aggressive advertising tactics will be outed, or so finds Digiday's John McDermott, who rounded up several blogs that do just that. The blogs that McDermott highlights include Crapshaming, WTF Mobile Web and more. Stuffing your site with ads at the cost of the user experience tells readers "that the publisher simply places more value on being liked on Facebook than they do on their own content. This seems like a pretty good indicator to me that I'm not going to value the content on there either," Andy Beaumont, a self-proclaimed  <http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001e0IymLCAx88xdmPJpiL1dI0vSfOT6QT90cTTylTSLxDkFNXfCaByH38p0moeEGJwEfUTXvxAkdhDJeqyhg5P2fpKBOM1fGA7v7YRs0kszMfEQk4NJ1F3Puhj1vuQ2Xkg> "angry adman" and creative technology director at Albion London, tells McDermott.
