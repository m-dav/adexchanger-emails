“Brands are better suited running their prospecting campaigns in the months leading up to the major shopping days, and then focus the media spend on those days to activate against customers that already in the brand funnel,” said YellowHammer SVP Sam Appelbaum.

News Round Up

Programmatic Parting?

Expect programmatic breakups in 2016, says VivaKi’s president of global clients, Marco Bertozzi. But who’s breaking up with whom, exactly? He doesn’t specify, but it’s clear Bertozzi’s skeptical of the direct-to-client deals that many ad tech vendors have worked toward. Deals that were originally established because “an advertiser ... wanted its own tech deal to go around the agency or publishers,” or because “procurement or the CEO [asked] questions of the brand manager and [made] them act." These partnerships, Bertozzi argues, were formed under intense strain and will lead to a harsh awakening for ad tech. Read Bertozzi’s column in Campaign US <http://go.adexchanger.com/FBDBL00tF0W0P2bq000AA04> .

Carrier-Level Ad Blocking

Digicel recently became the first mobile carrier <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0ub0LB0DB0G0W0q4P20A0A>  to install network-level ad-blocking technology. Shine, the Israeli company that provides the tech, says it has other carrier clients that prefer to stay quiet. Now Lara O’Reilly of Business Insider has Robert Franks, managing director of digital commerce at the British mobile carrier O2, all but announcing plans to do the same. "When I say we are looking at these technologies, we are not just paying lip service to them, we are absolutely having conversations which are well-advanced in terms of what that technology would do in in our network and other layers and how we would position this with customers." More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00B0vb0WHDP0L0A00> .

Wary About Whereabouts

“This app would like to use your current location.” The answer to that question for more and more mobile users is, “Don’t allow” – even when the utility is clear, like with weather apps. According to <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0wI02q0L0AB0DB00Ab4>  data from Skyhook Wireless, 35% of weather app users choose not to share their location – and that’s a pretty good number when compared with other popular app categories. Only 38% of users share location with social networking apps, a number that drops to 23% for travel apps, 18% for photo and video apps and 16% for news apps.

All Aboard

Fox Networks’ president of advanced advertising wishes he could, ironically, “go door to door and help people install ad blockers.” Joe Marchese, founder of video ad platform TrueX, which Fox acquired last December <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0BJ0B4L0x2AAP00q0Db00> , writes for WSJ that, “The situation with digital advertising is so dire that the only fix might be to reset.” It’s about as likely to happen as counting to infinity, but the ideal result would be a clear value exchange between a publisher and an individual, with flexible ad restriction or blocking options available for the visitor. <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40y0A2b0BKLD0WBP00q0A0>  More.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0Bz0B4L0q2AAP00q0D800> ANA Study: Most Marketers Would Shift Ad Spend Over Lack Of Third-Party Measurement
One of the battle cries among marketers of late is the need for third-party measurement independent of media ownership. The issue of independent measurement also came to light on the agency side following WPP’s investment in comScore.

News Round Up

Search Lurch

Following a drumbeat of complaints about Google’s app-install ad policies and potentially anti-competitive algorithm tweaks, local search players like Yelp and TripAdvisor noted last weekend they were getting buried in Google search results. Google responded by telling Re/code’s Mark Bergen, “The issues cited were caused by a recent code push, which we’re working quickly to fix.” Google fights hard against the narrative that it’s a monopolistic platform, but it’s hard to dispute its algorithm pushing users away from competitors even when search queries include company names like “Yelp,” “ZocDoc” and “Foursquare.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q08A0DB0Wz2Lq00BA00I4P0> .

Stormy C’s

A 2015 CMO Survey shows profound disconnects between the marketers and technologists at brands and agencies. Technology has become more consumer-facing, meaning company tech teams must take on some of the responsibilities of marketers, like concern over user experience. On the other hand, brand marketers are trying (and mostly failing) to learn new tech skills. But maybe collaboration isn’t so important: Only 20% of all marketers and 4% of IT executives said “working together has improved alignment.” More at Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0A80LB0DB0J0W0q4P20A0A> .

Vertical Integration

TV networks got hosed in this year’s upfronts, but the industry has been making up for the lost ground with a thriving spot sale market, where broadcast inventory is sold closer to the run date. However, a pair of WSJ reporters broke the news Tuesday that the Justice Department is probing alleged “monopolization or attempted monopolization” of the spot sales market. The problem comes down to the fact that many local pay-TV providers rely on heavyweights like Comcast or AT&T’s DirecTV to sell their spot ads, and the company that does spot cable buys for the nation’s biggest advertisers, NCC Media, happens to be owned by Comcast. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0B0BWD0L4PK0A2q080BA00> .

An Incomplete Fusion

A year ago, Fusion’s content team responsible for platform distribution had two people producing Instagram and Vine videos. Now, it’s a 12-person team, including eight responsible solely for Snapchat, according to Lucia Moses at Digiday. Distribution helps expand the audience base, but measurement and ROI challenges make it unclear whether monetization will follow. “We’re acutely aware that not only is there a lack of standardization but [also] tools to do that,” said Fusion CDO Daniel Eilemberg.

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/FBDBL00gm0W0P25q000AA04> Staples Affects In-Store Buying With Mobile Media
“Slingshot was a playful game that we thought would help our SMB customer see the breadth and value of Staples’ products,” said Jay Poropatich, director of digital marketing for Staples. “But then ultimately we wanted to use that engagement to target those individuals with more of a direct-response ad unit.”

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/BB00qW2A0000405B0DkLPqA> Data-Driven Thinking column...Walled Gardens: Learning From The Past To Predict The Future by Tom Triscari, Labmatik
Today we are seeing the resurrection of new walled gardens in which the bricks of better data make for a mightier wall of control. We have entered the age of control and data walls.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D005l0ALAWPrBB02q000> As Smart TV Service Providers Feud In Court, The Privacy Issue Lurks In The Wings
Although Samba TV CEO Ashwin Navin declined to comment on the pending litigation under guidance from his attorney, Ashish Chordia, CEO of Alphonso, called the lawsuit “a minor distraction.”

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWm400s0ABD0050BL02P0Aq> The Planets Are Aligning For Mobile Shopping This Holiday Season
“We see it as more of a Black November,” George Chang, SVP of sales and marketplace at Rakuten said. “In terms of how people spend dollars and go to market, you’ll see a more consistent approach throughout November across all channels.”

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DW54BA00tL0PB0n2> On TV & Video column...Traditional TV: The Next Emerging Device by Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan, Drawbridge
Having said that, TV has always been a "safe buy" for marketers, and making TV more targetable and measurable will make it ever safer. I'm not predicting the death of TV, but as its audience and ad dollars erode, it's time for marketers to take a fresh approach.

News Round Up

Exchange Dynamics

AppNexus continues to share results of its recent fraud cleanse, claiming that the huge drop off impressions led to parallel spikes in CTR, visibility and price. Catherine Williams, AppNexus’ chief data scientist and the leader of its internal inventory quality efforts, previously told AdExchanger <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pp4050DvABq2>  that rising prices almost made up for the lost revenue – though it did see a moderate slowdown. Is there a huge pool of big-dollar spenders just waiting for the young digital ecosystem to emerge from its cocoon? Let’s find out. More at The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/BB00wW2A0000405B0DqLPqA> . And read the AppNexus report <http://go.adexchanger.com/yB5WDqP00A0LABr04x00020> .

Learn From Your Elders

If today’s digital publishers could travel back in time to learn from an earlier market disruption, they might consider chatting with telcos in the 1990s, Phil Kyle writes for Ad Age. “Telcos used bundling to make it easier for consumers to buy more products simultaneously – and publishers should do the same today,” Kyle writes. There are huge ad budgets waiting on cohesive cross-channel campaigns (planning and execution across TV, digital, streaming and mobile) … so why not provide it via collaboration, bundled subscriptions and audience packaging? More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q05A0DB0Ws2Lq00BA00y4P0> .

Take Your Medicine

The merger of Pfizer with Allergan, an Irish pharmaceutical leader, creates a $155 billion behemoth and a very consequential advertiser. Even before the acquisition, Pfizer was a top-10 global spender per Kantar. But! Steven Perlberg of The Wall Street Journal points out the American Medical Association recently called for an end to direct-to-consumer pharma  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tz0W50P0B000DBt20L4qAA0> ads. The issue revolves around the hospital impact of consumers requesting more expensive treatments. A real nail-biter for publishers. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0BAAA0Du500> .

Data, On Hand

Mobile isn’t its own channel so much as the connective tissue for all marketing outreach. At least that’s the argument made by Ben Phillips, Mediacom’s head of mobile, writing for M&M Global. No matter where your audience finds your content – from a TV commercial to a radio ad to a coupon sent via beacon geolocation – mobile is the feedback, optimization and data tool. “The bottom line is that mobile data now drives most planning. … Mobile has moved beyond the channel silo and become the glue that links everything we do.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPBv05q0AD00B4B020W0> .

It’s the latest step in MoPub’s journey toward being an “and” platform, rather than an “either/or” solution. In other words, making it into one-stop monetization shop, Janae McDonough said.

All Fun And Games

“Last year the analytics firm Deepfield found that Twitch regularly broke into the top four users of Internet bandwidth, trailing only Netflix, Google, and Apple,” according to a deep dive into the video game streaming platform from a pair of Bloomberg reporters. That’s an impressive stat, even with the outsized bandwidth drain of live streaming. Live video game viewing is almost a $4 billion category and features a wide variety of incremental revenue opportunities – which is likely why Amazon’s Twitch now finds itself in contention with Google’s YouTube, where the most popular “artist” of all time is actually a Swedish video gamer.

Rock On Groupon

Groupon’s newly ascendant CEO, Rich Williams, composed a note claiming the company had made strategic mistakes in the past, but was misunderstood by the media and analyst community. Peter Krasilovsky gives his take at the Local Onliner (and isn’t particularly impressed). What happened to former initiatives like offer personalization, food delivery, loyalty and point-of-sale programs, self-serve deals and the publisher network? But Groupon does have a million merchants and 50 million members. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABL1WT0APBV020qD40> .

The Brick-And-Mortar Burden

Walmart and Target are doing just fine, thank you very much, but both have seen stunted digital growth this year despite high expectations. Ecommerce represented only 0.15% of Walmart’s growth in the past quarter compared to the same period last year, according to MarketWatch reporter Tonya Garcia. Laura Kennedy, a director at Kantar Retail, says, “Amazon is changing what people expect not just from the online experience but from the overall shopping experience,” citing product reviews, wide assortments and free shipping.

Spend Money To Make Money

When a company with a noteworthy media budget goes bankrupt, it’s often the ad networks and tech companies that get stiffed in Chapter 11. For example, Garett Sloane writes for Digiday that when Rdio went down the tubes, it owed Facebook $500 million. The problem keenly impacts app publishers. Sloane cites one publisher who says Facebook’s app-install market is oversaturated, and many times more expensive than Google’s. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000012VB0L0B0XA4PDAq> .

Goal-driven marketers should not care if Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Walmart, The New York Times or YouTube advertising sold their product or added to brand perception. The New York Times is not just a branding medium, just as search engines are not just performance mediums.

News Round Up

Meh-surement

For the social marketer, it’s easy to set and then confirm certain performance metrics on YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest and so on. Engagement, visibility, views, likes and shares are all among the well-worn data points. But Snapchat has no such features, and since it also doesn’t have an API, there’s essentially no way for brands to confirm a campaign even ran unless the viewer takes a screenshot to send to the marketer. As one Snapchat spender tells The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Shields, “You can have millions of dollars paid out in these campaigns, and they’re basically being run on screenshots and text messages between C-level executives and teenagers.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DZA02000BWW0q4AVLP0A> .

Google Store, Google Rules

Google has told its developer community that any ad-supported app must be identified as such in the Play Store. The change, which takes effect in January, is an expansion of Google’s “Designed for Families” program, which forces apps to disclose upfront that they feature in-app purchases. That earlier change was essentially born out of parents frustrated by children downloading free apps and then racking up in-app purchases. The news was first reported by Kellen Barranger at Droid Life <http://go.adexchanger.com/g00D40L0q20ABA0AW000XXP> .

Direct: Ain’t It Grand?

It’s now accepted wisdom that the publisher stack of the future will feature the direct sale front and center. Sonobi, a one-time ad network that has repositioned as a programmatic platform, knows this and has rolled out a "guaranteed" solution called Jetstream. Key players on the buy side include MediaMath and Merkle. "We've built an agency suite to make it easier to get access to supply," product head John Donahue told attendees at the company's New York event on Thursday. <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0AYA0q010BAL0PDX2>  Press release.

Piling On

Yahoo has been taking a beating in the press. The latest ugliness: In a letter sent Thursday <http://go.adexchanger.com/yAXWDqP00A0LAB204Z00020> , Yahoo stakeholder Starboard Ventures is pushing the company to abandon the attempt to spin off its 15% share of Alibaba, and instead sell the core business. The research firm L2 writes <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLXW30APA0020qD40>  that Yahoo can neither buy nor build its way out of this mess: “Yahoo’s acquisition team showing up at your door can only mean that your company is about to fail – and you’re about to get rich.” The once-vaunted digital player can also look forward to the December edition of Forbes magazine, which will feature a story titled “The Last Days Of Marissa Mayer? <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPA44B00W000qAX0020A1D> ” Oof.

Campaign efficacy should be the goal for all involved in ad delivery, but it isn’t for today’s data market. In reality, sellers help buyers zero out their budgets because if they don’t, another vendor will.

News Round Up

European Opportunities

MediaMath has acquired Spree7, a German programmatic firm that it previously invested in as a joint venture with PubliGroupe. Ronan Shields writes for The Drum that Germany represents a unique opportunity, as it’s one of Europe’s strongest markets, but “programmatic is only expected to have 31% market penetration in Germany come 2017. This is compared to figures of 60% in Holland, 59% in the UK, and 56% in France.” Spree7 CEO Viktor Zawadzki (no relation to MediaMath CEO Joe Zawadzki) will now run MediaMath’s regional business.

Ghosts In The Machine

Fraud detection firm Pixalate claims to have discovered a botnet, dubbed Xindi, that could cost advertisers as much as $3 billion by the end of next year. According to Pixalate, Xindi is designed to go after enterprise-level networks – universities, Fortune 500 companies, government organizations – which creates more valuable inventory and skirts detection. However, Ad Age reporter George Slefo notes that “It wasn't immediately possible to confirm Pixalate's findings on the botnet,” and no victimized networks have stepped forward.

The Boob Tube

NBC’s political editor, Mark Murray, questions the TV-first strategy that’s driving Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign. The Bush campaign and super PAC supporters have spent $20M on TV ads (next highest are Clinton and Rubio at around $8M), but that hasn’t corresponded with any polling bounce. Republican digital media experts have also started to complain that TV fundamentally disadvantages their side, because super PACs (which lean heavily toward conservative causes) pay three or four times more than a campaign (where most of the liberal spending comes from) for the same buys.

Publisher Belt-Tightening

“It’s been tough the last few months,” Condé Nast President Bob Sauerberg tells The Wall Street Journal’s Jeffrey Trachtenberg. Despite moderate digital and print growth, Condé Nast is shuttering Details, a fashion magazine aimed at young men. “Consumers love the magazine. It’s not fair or right,” says Sauerberg. The publisher is also combining ad sales staff at Glamour and Self magazines, and the move comes shortly after food-centric properties Epicurious and Bon Appétit were consolidated.

"It was really interesting that a trailer actually drives more viewership initially, but that viewership is actually less engaged because you’ve already given them a taste of what it is they’ll actually see," Refinery29's Patrick Yee said.

News Round Up

Swimming Upstream

Pandora announced plans <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0OPAWPD0A00>  Monday to acquire the assets of Rdio, a streaming music service that will be going through bankruptcy. BTIG Research media and tech analyst Richard Greenfield posted a blog post Tuesday morning that takes a distinctly pessimistic tone on Pandora’s prospects. Following the company’s $450M purchase of Ticketfly earlier this year, Greenfield says, “Despite Pandora’s lack of meaningful profitability and cash flow generation, [new CEO Brian McAndrews] has launched an acquisition spree that reeks of desperation to pivot the company beyond advertising.” And the market will only grow more cutthroat, as Pandora is coming more directly into competition with Spotify, Apple and Google.

Agency No Evil, Speak No Evil

Outgoing GroupM CEO Kelly Clark issued a staff memo regarding leaks around remuneration and agency rebates (aka kickbacks), a topic that dramatically seized ad tech and media-buying agencies after former Mediacom CEO Jon Mandel noted the practice in an ANA presentation <http://go.adexchanger.com/gQ0D40L0q20ABA0AW000FPP> . With Xaxis CEO Brian Lesser ascending to the GroupM throne, the opacity of margin generation within WPP subsidiaries will likely remain a touchy subject. Steve McClellan at MediaPost notes that Clark explicitly named two firms that may look to pry info from GroupM employees: K2 and Ebiquity (which were recently hired by the ANA <http://go.adexchanger.com/qAAW0A0DLG004P02B0PR00q>  to investigate agency rebates).

A New Kind Of Strategic Buyer

Customer acquisition startup Fluent has pursued a strategy of buying or building an archive of digital consumer profiles. And that strategy just officially paid off, as Florida-based IDI, a data solutions provider with a background in risk management, agreed to acquire Fluent for more than $100 million. IDI Executive Chairman Michael Brauser echoes many long-established enterprise data firms when he says, “We believe the timing is right to accelerate our growth plan into the consumer marketing industry.” Read the release for more <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00TWqA000APPA0I040D2L> .

Snowden Says: Block Ads

In a recent interview with The Intercept, Edward Snowden said it’s every person’s civic duty to block ads. He said, “As long as service providers are serving ads with active content that require the use of JavaScript to display, that have some kind of active content like Flash embedded in it, anything that can be a vector for attack in your web browser – you should be actively trying to block these. Because if the service provider is not working to protect the sanctity of the relationship between reader and publisher, you have not just a right but a duty to take every effort to protect yourself in response.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02U000JP00APW04DABAqL0> Read it. Mashable picked up the soundbite and ran with it.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/gV0D40L0q20ABA0AW000KPP> Read that.

News Round Up

The Power Index

Last Friday, Facebook started allowing Google to crawl and index across its mobile app. The partnership, though narrow, is notable because of how rarely the two alpha competitors from the web and app world find common cause. The Wall Street Journal reports that Google searches can now display relevant Facebook profile info and will deep link users directly to the app. Other app-discovery startups have tried to step into the vacuum Google leaves in the space, and an early partnership with Facebook (on top of existing integrations with Twitter) could quash what little room there is for competition. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0eAA00ZLD0AP00040> .  

Learning The New Playbook

IBM is one of the world’s corporate giants, with 370,000 employees and a market cap over $180 billion, but there are sharp, swerving changes underway for the tech titan. The company has invested in new technology that is “design-focused” (which is not actually focused on design, but on products built to fit the end user). To stem the tide of business toward digital and away from legacy services, NYT reporter Steve Lohr says IBM is pushing internally to “talk a lot about “iteration cycles,” “lateral thinking,” “user journeys” and “empathy maps.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4L000P00qD002LBW0fAA> .

The Greater Good

Google is closer to having its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMPs) – an answer to Facebook’s Instant Articles – in fighting shape. The company is framing the product as a kind of digital community service, with publishers eagerly on board. But (anonymous) publishers have their concerns, including paywall gating and analytics – as Google strips tags. “The AMP format in effect makes Google the gatekeeper on ad formats and analytics scripts,” writes Capital NY’s Ken Doctor. “This will allow it to prevent heavy ads and intrusive scripts from being deployed on mobile, both of which are vital if the rise of ad blockers is to be stemmed.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4L010P00qD002LBW0gAA> .

Traditional CTV?

According to new data from eMarketer, IP-connected TV may end up looking a lot like…linear TV. Primetime accounted for 22% of CTV’s daily ad requests in Q2 2015, according to Tremor Video. To be fair, that figure is vendor-specific, but Nielsen data also found share of US audiences for CTV peaked during primetime. Translation? CTV resembles consumption patterns of traditional broadcast TV in contrast to a channel like mobile where consumption is more dispersed. <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0hAA002LD0AP00040>  More.

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DAA02000BWH0q4AhLP0A> Teradata Cuts Ties With The Marketing Stack
“Teradata seems to have made a quick decision driven by the Street,” said Martin Kihn, a research director at Gartner. “They’re sending the signal that they’re focusing on their core and monetizing an asset that could be better used by someone else.”

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPAE4B00W000qAH0020AlD> Data-Driven Thinking column...Since Real-World Places Are Dynamic, Geofences Should Be, Too by Alistair Goodman, Placecast
In my experience, it’s possible to boost lift in performance by most measures – awareness, clicks, store visits – by as much as 50% by actively optimizing geofencing strategy on a mobile-location campaign.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0FH0LA0DB0m0W0q4P20A0A> The Industry Starts To Rally Around Location Data Accuracy, But It’s A Long Road Ahead
The industry must standardize how to measure offline foot traffic generated from mobile marketing, said MMA CEO Greg Stuart. This will bring “clarity into a space that is today burgeoning with varied methods and competing claims. Standardization benefits us all.”

News Round Up

Pushing Back On Netflix

Disney has worked out a licensing agreement on at least one ABC show that stipulates Netflix must run a four-second pre-roll video before episodes (not a full ad, but the ABC logo, some creative based on the show and ABC theme music). Netflix has fought and compromised over similar issues, such as allowing network logos on title cards, but the tension between telcos and Netflix is heightening. The WSJ’s Joe Flint quotes one anonymous studio chief saying, “They are going to have to find ways to accommodate the needs of the people they buy shows from. The platform should be obligated to offer that little bit of branding material.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0AAAr0DKH00> .

Paying Up On Hulu

Hulu is owned by the great media triumvirate of Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast. Now the streaming service is looking to add a familiar face, pushing its three investors to sell off some shares to make room for Time Warner as an equal partner at a $5B valuation. This continues Hulu’s strategy of obtaining programming via ownership stakes, as the company positions itself as the broadcasters’ potential solution should they become disenchanted with Netflix.

The Marketer Pot Of Gold

Online wish lists are a convenient bookmarking service for consumers, and a potential treasure trove for marketers. “It gives you live data about purchase intent and preferences, and allows you to use dynamic pricing to build up a relationship,” says Simon Hathaway, chief retail officer at the Cheil Network, to Ad Age reporter Emma Hall. With the traditional path to purchase replaced by a messy mix of search, sharing, research and leisure discovery, wish lists represent an oasis of intent. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPAM4B00W000qAH0020AtD> .

Snap, Chat, Buy

Snapchat has been churning out new ad products and incremental revenue streams for months, but don’t expect that pace to fall off. According to Kurt Wagner at Re/code, the messaging app is “throwing all kinds of ideas at the wall to see what sticks.” On Friday, for example, it debuted a new lens store, where users can buy graphics and special effects for 99 cents. In September, the service also started allowing users to rewatch past posts for a small fee <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0H0P4qA02000WLN0u0AADB> . But cents can add up to big dollars, and if Snapchat can demonstrate that users spend cash flexibly on the platform, there will be marketing implications.

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0AAAj0DIB00> As Publishers Feel Viewability Crunch, Buyers Promise The Money Will Come
“Everything is measured. Nobody’s happy,” said Jason Baird, VP of revenue operations for Condé Nast, riffing on a line from comedian Louis CK. “Every time a new performance metric is introduced or a vendor updates with a new methodology, discrepancies increase."

“Considering the contention and misinformation that’s out there, I think it was a good first step by the Adblock Plus team to just get people at the table,” said Craig Spiezle, president of the Online Trust Alliance and one of the representatives at the meeting. “I hope they took away from this how complex the process and mechanisms need to be, because the Acceptable Ads criteria has lacked that objectivity and nuance.”

Facebook topic data isn’t about quantifying the impact of seeing an ad or attributing back to a sale. For that, brands can run ad campaigns on Facebook and use its conversion attribution tools.

News Round Up

Sizmek Points To PointRoll

PointRoll is like a little hot potato getting tossed from owner to owner. Its latest handler: ad tech company Sizmek for the modest sum of $20 million. Read Ad Age’s story <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000t2040qAALPDBBS0WA0> . PointRoll focuses on rich media technologies and was purchased by Gannett in 2005 for about $100 million. It got spun off earlier this year into a company called Tegna, which combined PointRoll with ShopLocal into an entity called Cofactor. It’ll be interesting to see how PointRoll gets incorporated into Sizmek, where many a rich media ad server has been put out to pasture (See: EyeWonder, EyeBlaster) whose rich media business has been victimized by quarterly declines.   

Leap Of Faith

CMO Today looks at the yield publishers are getting from Facebook’s Instant Articles program. It’s early to draw big conclusions, but monetization challenges include a lighter ad load and a Facebook-imposed ban on rich media, but it might all be worth it in the end. “It all comes down to how Facebook prioritizes this in news feed. We’ve seen them prioritize video, and if they do anything similar with Instant Articles the numbers could go through the roof.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0uL0000BP02BAqDA0T40A> More.

Trading Access For Revenue

Companies like Vice and The Huffington Post turned their digital video chops into big valuations. Reuters is trying to figure out what model works for a legacy player with resources. The news pub recently axed its pay-TV service, but evidently now sees potential scale by offering a free video app. Sahil Patel writes for Digiday that part of the expansion features a free product, “TV for Publishers,” which will let any site embed Reuters’ streaming service into its feed and sell ads on the content, with the site keeping all the revenue. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/AB0v04WB200AAPq00L0U0DA> .

Losing Agency

Collapsing supply chains <http://go.adexchanger.com/AB0w04WB200AAPq00L0V0DA>  is not only a digital phenomenon. Ad Age’s Jeanine Poggi reports  NBC just executed a reorg aimed at bringing its ad sales teams closer to actual marketers, to the possible detriment of client-agency relationships. As put by Linda Yaccarino, NBC chairwoman of advertising sales and client partnerships, “We continue to work very closely with our agency partners, but clients are asking for more direct access to us as one portfolio.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00BW0ALAWPxAB02q000> .

All In On The Wallet

The New York Times follows up on previous reporting <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0AyA0000q0DX20LAWB>  with new anonymous tidbits about Apple’s peer-to-peer payment service, an attempt to get iPhone owners to actually use Apple Wallet. Sources say Apple is rounding up banking partners and could be ready to compete with PayPal’s Venmo or Square’s Square Cash in 2016. Apple has said it’s goal is nothing short of “replacing the wallet,” but fewer than one in five iPhone owners use the app. Read <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0YAA00zBD0AP00040> .

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000y2WA0L0B0uA4PDAq> Financial Times Talks Progress On Time-Based Buying
The Times decided to charge for an ad after five seconds because data from its viewability provider, Chartbeat, showed “that was the tipping point for when it became valuable or made an impact on the reader,” said the publisher’s US commercial director, Brendan Spain.

News Round Up

A Gentler SSP

The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Shields profiles publisher ad ops vendor Media Operative, and finds the company has made inroads with a new wave of programmatic-averse publishers by helping them mediate between sales channels. Its new customers include Vice Media, Vox Media and Refinery29. “We become like their air traffic control system, and they have all the control,” says Media Operative CEO Lorne Browne. The story concludes, “It remains to be seen whether all these newer digital players will be able to maintain their limited ad tech stance, and resist the urge to sell inventory on multiple ad exchanges as they grow.” It also remains to be seen whether those exchanges continue to support the impression resale activity that has given them a bad name in some circles.

Defending Price Floors

In response to an AdExchanger column by Varick Media SVP Jim Caruso that took a strong, pro-buyer stance <http://go.adexchanger.com/yAzWDqP00A0LAB704G00020>  on digital media-buying transparency, AppNexus SVP and GM Andy Atherton writes a blog post saying, “No, price floors are not fraud <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB008WqA000APzA0H040D2L> .” Atherton argues that there are plenty of inequities in the market. (After all, nobody says it’s wrong that buyers capitalize on their unique knowledge of users when a pub undervalues its own inventory.) The bottom line is “sellers should be free to use any and all (legal) tools available to them to manage their businesses in any way they think will meet their business objectives. Buyers are free to change bidding strategy, negotiate special terms or look elsewhere if economics on a transaction don’t work for them.”

When A Single Is A Home Run

Black Friday? Cyber Monday? Amazon Prime Day? Pshaw. Singles’ Day in China was responsible for more than $14.3 billion in sales on Alibaba’s consumer shopping sites on Wednesday, reports Bloomberg News. That’s a 57% increase over last year. For a little perspective: Cyber Monday, which shattered online shopping records in the US, hit $2 billion in 2014. Singles’ Day – so named because it falls on 11/11, a date comprised entirely of ones – was trademarked by Alibaba in 2012, and company Chairman Jack Ma has big plans to globalize the event in the future.

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000G2040qAALPDBvb0WA0> Programmatic Is Full Steam Ahead As Tech Leaders Move Up The WPP Ranks
Brian Lesser and other WPP executives say recent developments don't indicate a strategic shift at GroupM so much as a strategic acceleration, driven in part by long-term tech bets but also by the day-to-day demands for talent and resources.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/yAvWDqP00A0LABf04K00020> Data-Driven Thinking column...Real-Time Data Isn’t Always Necessary by Jeff Bander, Sticky
Instead of jumping on the real-time marketing bandwagon and deferring it to the “experimental” marketing budget, brands should constantly ask themselves key questions to uncover the value of pursuing a time-based strategy.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0vA0DB0Wg2Lq00AA00L4P0> It's A Post-Install World, Advertisers Need To Pay To Live In It
The cost to acquire a loyal user, defined as someone who opens an app three times or more, increased nearly 80% from $2.25 to $4.05 in the 12 months beginning last September.

News Round Up

URLs vs. SDKs

People talk about apps making the web obsolete, but Flipkart, the Indian ecommerce giant, has partnered with Google to create a site that steals utility from apps (i.e., it can send push notifications, read info while the user is offline, access hardware like a phone’s camera and grab location-based data), according to Katie Benner at the NYT. It’s likely to ring consumer alarm bells, and the capabilities on offer show the value Google gains from cross-pollinating hardware, media, tech and services. Wrap Media founder Eric Greenberg summed up the incentives for Google: “As long as the web isn’t really usable on a mobile phone, Apple wins.” Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqPP04A0LB0WAv02A0000kD> on.

Video’s Photo Finish

A pair of WSJ articles examine the two most prominent competitors for YouTube’s digital video throne: Facebook and Snapchat. Mike Shields reports that web publishers are following in Facebook’s footsteps <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00Q0lL0vW00AD2q0AA04>  by embracing autoplay videos. Facebook’s video views jumped from 4 billion in April to 8 billion now, though the autoplay nature of its clips creates genuine engagement and user experience concerns. Snapchat is racing Facebook, “like stock cars trying to pass each other,” reporting video growth from 2 billion to 6 billion in the same period. The obvious question to ask: “When autoplay videos pass through a scrolling feed of content, what counts as a view anyway?” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00vA0L0Dm00AB2qW0ARP04> .

The Insta Filter

Instagram announced in a company blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0nv0LA0DB0S0W0q4P20A0A>  Monday that it has created a partner program (which includes 40 vendors) “to make it easier for advertisers of any size to find the best-in-class technology.” Since opening its ads API a few months ago, Instagram has had to beat back user and observer complaints <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0TL0000vP02BAqDA0o40A>  regarding a drop-off in ad quality. What it boils down to is that the Instagram feed is prized for its image quality and design, but inept SMB marketers without agencies are mucking it up.

The App-Install Lotto

“There isn’t a single brand in the world, consumer product, automotive or travel brand, that will spend as much money on mobile ads as apps,” according to Opera Mediaworks CEO Mahi de Silva. Even though any given user spends a huge majority of his or her time in just a handful of apps, app-install ads are driving much of mobile marketing. According to Digiday’s Garett Sloane, it’s a twofold push, as gamemakers behind hits like “Clash of Clans” and “Game of War” throw nine-digit budgets at app installs, while VC-funded startups hope to be among the 10% of apps that don’t flame out of existence.

Demandbase’s Data Cloud

Demandbase has its head in the clouds. The B2B advertising platform rolled out a B2B data cloud, built on the back of a behavioral data repository it inherited through an <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0v0P4qA02000WLq0V0AADB>  acquisition of marketing data company WhoToo. B2B marketers are in want of more data and ways to <http://go.adexchanger.com/lvBqW000LADP0A2A4000r0W>  bridge the gap between demand generation and branding campaigns. Demandbase sees the B2B data cloud as an inroad there, and wants to give B2B marketers the pipes between CRM, marketing automation and digital advertising. <http://go.adexchanger.com/us0000DB4L0A0X02vPqWAA0>  Release.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0Ag0B4L0Q2AAP00q0Dq00> Publishers And Marketers Are Anteing Up – And Networks Are Folding
Brands and publishers are increasingly bringing effective first-party data into their digital buys, and they want certain levels of performance and reliability on the open exchange.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PAk00q2U0q> Data-Driven Thinking column...Are Artificial Price Floors The Next Iteration Of Ad Fraud? by Jim Caruso, Varick Media Management
Buyers will often place very high bids on desirable inventory, assuming that they will pay far less for an impression when they win the bid. However, when the value of an impression is falsely represented, the trust between buyer and seller is quickly lost.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWV400l0ABD00q0AL02P0Aq> As Innovid Forges Connected TV Ties, It Sets Its Sights On Programmatic Creative
“We have data and advanced segmentation, but why is it that we still see the same automobile ad served to the entire US population?” said Zvika Netter, co-founder and CEO of Innovid. “You can set reach and frequency targets, but there’s disconnect between reaching your audience goals and knowing you reached an individual with relevant creative.”

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0A00qqmW> Time Inc. Has Mobile Gaming On The Mind With Trivia Crack Partnership
“We’re quickly evolving from being a print company to a content and audience company,” said Steven Haft, SVP of innovation at Time Inc. “Like most publishers today, more than half of our digital audience is coming from mobile devices, and if we want to reach those people, we have to make our content available wherever they are.”

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0AAAn0DXq00> CPAX Adds Four Publishers, Runs 1 Billion Impressions A Month
The new publishers are joining because CPAX offers premium CPMs over the open exchange without the fear of low-quality ads. Buyers on CPAX join on an invitation-only basis, which helps winnow away unsavory advertisers.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWY400o0ABD00q0AL02P0Aq> Will The Rise Of Subscription Services Usurp Ad-Supported Video?
“If you think about all of the content we consume that is supported by an advertising model, if a consumer had to pay for it discretely, you wouldn’t complain about a $100 cable bill anymore – you’d be complaining about $1,000 worth of content,” said David Mendels, CEO of Brightcove.

Brands Turn On The Tube

Video DSP TubeMogul grew its revenue by 70% in Q3 to $46.5 million. Total ad spend increased 65% to $62.5 million, as the company signed preferred video platform partnerships with brands like L'Oréal USA and Dannon. TubeMogul also teamed up with 50 publishers and broadcasters to launch a programmatic direct offering, called Select Access, with 4 billion available impressions projected for 2016. “TV is still the best way to quickly build reach with a target audience,” said Brett Wilson, TubeMogul’s CEO, but added that “after the initial burst of spend, the implication is you end up reaching fewer and fewer new people with more and more ad exposures.” TubeMogul’s <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0rA0DB0W02Lq00AA00r4P0>  new cross-screen planning system is designed to mitigate that.

YaWho?

Yahoo appears to be on a negative swing, with its recent dismissal from the Snapchat Discover Page, tepid stock growth and an exodus of executive talent. Now Kara Swisher reports for Re/code that embattled CEO Marissa Mayer has brought in McKinsey & Co. to make some tough calls on units to shutter, invest in or sell. Yahoo still aims to rebuild around its core ad business once it’s down to fighting trim. Sources tell Swisher that Mayer has been demanding execs agree to three- to five-year commitments, which precipitated key departures. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DABqA0020P0W2Art00> .

Give And Take

One of the standing retailer complaints about ecommerce markets is that they convert on single sales, but deprive the brand of potential lifetime customers. Publishers are finding much the same with Facebook. The social media giant shares fun-size revenue bites via its Instant Articles and ad products, but the actual referrals back to publisher sites have dropped by a third so far this year, according to data from SimilarWeb reported by Digiday’s Lucia Moses. Facebook says it’s a result of more content on the site diluting the reach of individual posts, not deliberate fiddling with referral knobs.

Ad Blockers Under The Glass

Google is preparing a study of ad-blocking habits to identify precisely what motivates the practice. Frédéric Filloux <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPA40rq0AD00B4v020W0>  writes in The Monday Note, “A (large) unspecified number of people will go through what is called a Cognitive Load Test in which users are compensated for reading as many articles as possible. Different series of stories will carry various ads formats, ranging from the most invasive to the lightest.” Filloux goes on to discuss the implication of rampant ad blocking for publisher sales teams and marketing organizations, and how those constituents should respond to this slow-motion disaster.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBw000ArA0A200WL4qP500> Read on.

Direct vs. Brand?

Seth Godin pens a blog post on the confluence of brand and performance marketing. TL;DR version: It’s uncomfortable for all parties. “If you're a direct marketer, your peers are going to push you to make ads that are more palatable to a brand marketer's sensibility,” Godin writes. 
“The problem with this, of course, is that you'll end up neither here nor there. You won't be culturally embraced the way an actual brand marketer can be, and you won't generate the yield you were looking for.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PxB00000Ar4Dq02AW60> Read it.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0A00oqLn> How Frito-Lay Levels The Playing Field Between TV, Digital And Offline For NFL Promos
"We still have a significant investment in TV but what you’re seeing is less investment in other traditional media channels [like] radio, out of home, print. We’re focusing more of our media on TV and digital," said Dana Lawrence, senior director of North America marketing.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLoWr0APAP020qD40> Data-Driven Thinking column...As Ad Blocking Grows, What Legal Recourse Do Publishers And Marketers Have? by Richard Eisert, Davis & Gilbert
It will take time for this legal landscape to further develop, but as it does, it’s a safe bet that the key parties involved will be watching closely. As ad-blocking technologies continue to evolve at ever-increasing speed, purely legal solutions will have trouble keeping pace.

"First, it’s to focus on a broad player network. Second, it’s participation across multiple categories and genres. And third, it’s developing leading mobile franchises," said CEO Mark Pincus.

Even a site that gets two minutes from a user every day of the month captures only one-half of 1% of that user’s online time. Facebook alone captures upward of 20% of time spent for some demographics.

News Round Up

Video Leaderboard

Snapchat logs 6 billion video views per day, tripling activity on the app since May, Tim Bradshaw reports for the Financial Times, citing sources at the company. That’s not too far behind Facebook’s 8 billion and YouTube’s murkier “billions” of daily views. “Video is fast becoming one of the most popular activities on social networking apps, and the race for eyeballs comes as analysts predict huge growth in digital video advertising,” Bradshaw writes. Most astonishing of all? Video on Facebook and Snapchat still goes almost entirely unmonetized. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/BA00VW2A000040oB0DxLPqA> .

Publisher Schadenfreude

News Corp., Time Inc. and Tribune Publishing all were recently offloaded by corporate parents. As Ravi Somaiya reports for The New York Times, those splits were framed as “for the best” for the publishers, but it’s been a struggle. Heavyweights like The Wall Street Journal, Time, Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune are seeing revenues crumble (with digital growth insufficient to replace print declines). Somaiya paraphrases news company CEOs on their earnings reports, who feel that “when the advertising market, going through its own turmoil, settles, (we) will be well positioned to take advantage of it.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/FADBL00yW0W0P2oq000AA04> .

’Baba’s Bid For Video

If Amazon bought YouTube, you’d have a rough equivalent of the Alibaba-Youku acquisition. Bloomberg reports that Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce giant, has agreed to purchase a Chinese video portal with about 286 million unique visitors per month, in a deal valued at $4.8B. In a bid to bulk up on streaming video, billionaire Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma is looking to compete more head-on with competitors Baidu and Tencent for greater share of Chinese media – with resources for content and films. Contrast that with Amazon’s original series <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0oWD0LX000B4000Az>  push. More on <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0AoAWPY0A00>  Bloomberg.

The Platform Age

In separate stories, USA Today <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0A00oqZB>  and The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00oC0ALAWP0AB02q000>  examine how a handful of companies (all from Seattle or Silicon Valley) have consolidated power across hardware, cloud services, messaging, media, search and apps. Says one Deutsche Bank analyst, “All of these companies are operating in industries where scale is rewarded and where there is a very high level of capital intensity required to even hope to compete.”

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P540k0DpAAq2> Verizon Rewards Program Draws Customer Ire, Putting Mobile Data Sharing At Risk
Verizon aside, consumers aren’t going to jump through hoops to take advantage of a loyalty program if they don’t perceive the value or if they’re “forced to jump through hoops every single time they try to use it,” said Zach Goldstein, CEO and founder of customer retention and loyalty startup Thanx.

"Beyond picking segments, I sometimes ask digital DSPs to show me unduplicated (or 'new') reach and frequency for a campaign that’s running and they can't do it," said Jim Nail, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. "There is still this classic divide between the TV and digital people."

“A siloed, platform-first view is no longer sufficient for measurement audience planning, transacting and optimizing advertising,” comScore CEO Serge Matta told investors during the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Thursday.

Dynamic ad insertion can only occur through pay TV distributors, which control the pipes and have set-top boxes in each home. Most of these companies will only sell addressable ads through traditional sales channels – their own sales teams – at a high premium.

News Round Up

Greater Lesser

WPP Group media agency network GroupM named Xaxis CEO Brian Lesser to helm its North America business, Ad Age’s Alexandra Bruell reports. "It reflects the direction we're going in in terms of our data and technology and driving that business forward on the back of the investments we made recently," said GroupM’s global president, Dominic Proctor. "Now we're bringing it in line with our management strategy." With the promotion, Brian Gleason takes over as CEO of Xaxis globally. More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00gWqA000APkA0A040D2L> 

Ad Blocker Buys Ad

The Israeli ad blocker Shine took out a full-page ad in the Financial Times on Thursday depicting Muhammad Ali towering over Sonny Liston, with a barb for the IAB (and an antagonistic new site <http://go.adexchanger.com/BA00BW2A000040kB0DhLPqA>  page). In an email to Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pi40k0DCAAq2> , IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg responded in kind, saying Shine is funded by foreign interests “for the express purpose of stealing money from advertisers and publishers and diverting it into the pockets of giant cell phone carriers.” Shine’s danger to publishers doesn’t stem from its aggressive paid media, it comes from network-level ad-blocking deals the company has with mobile carriers. (Only Digicel <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqDB0A2LW004D0P0AAj0k00>  has publicly acknowledged implementation, though Shine claims there are others.) Rothenberg signed off with the final note: “I hope they buy millions of dollars of more advertising before they die.”

Facebook’s Brick-And-Mortar Play

Facebook announced two new shopping product features on Thursday, each aimed at helping local businesses. The first enables businesses with multiple locations or branches to format ads and deals for individual locations (for instance, directing someone to the nearby cafe, with a specific deal). Facebook will also now provide general demographic and audience data about the people it can identify around the store, tracking foot traffic trends and potential customer segments. Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0kkAWPE0A00> .

Programmatic Video Percentages

Tremor Video’s revenue grew 26.2% year over year to $49.3 million in the third quarter, with programmatic now totaling 35% of total revenue. For the first time, Tremor broke out programmatic, nonprogrammatic (what it calls “higher-function” offerings like its all-screen solution) and media network revenue, its legacy business that’s declining as more budgets move to programmatic. Tremor has signed 250 publishers to its new supply-side solution and cited a new contract with Dentsu-Aegis trade desk Amnet on the buy side. <http://go.adexchanger.com/qAAW0A0DLF004k02B0Pl00q>  The earnings. And, YuMe also reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0kA0DB0Wm2Lq00AA00G4P0> .

The Redwoods

New research from Forrester, Gartner and IDC all point to massive expansion in a few tech sectors. Steve Lohr of The New York Times writes that “cloud computing is fast becoming the fundamental technology engine in corporations,” tripling to a $500 billion sector by 2020. It’s not all sunny skies though, as the reports also indicate a painful consolidation. “The candidate survivors included Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, IBM and two Chinese companies, Alibaba and Tencent,” with Apple as another entry.

News Round Up

Get With The Times

The New York Times has carved out a subscription revenue stream that other publications can only admire, but “video still hasn't become a significant revenue driver for the company,” according to Politico. And the result is a wholesale digital video overhaul. According to Joe Pompeo, the Gray Lady is offering buyouts to its video department and making new hires. We’ll see if the new talent leads to a shift in focus from video and photojournalism production to a sponsored content studio. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0gA0DB0WC2Lq00AA00S4P0> .

Looping In The Audio

Spotify is rolling out its programmatic ad offering. Ronan Shields reports for The Drum that Spotify’s first-party data will allow advertisers to target genre or moods (i.e., R&B or ‘Workout’). The company’s head of programmatic, Jana Jakovljevic, said there are disadvantages since Spotify doesn’t enable cookies, retargeting or post-view attribution. But still, according to Jakovljevic, "The missing piece of the puzzle has been programmatic, and that's now here today.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00gD0ALAWPTAB02q000> .

RFPeace Out

GE CMO Linda Boff pens a column for Ad Age arguing that the traditional RFP and media buy should be replaced with a more dynamic partnership model. Boff points to recent GE-sponsored segments on “The Tonight Show,” a content hub at Quartz and a series on National Geographic as prime examples of how marketing is improved by brands and media working directly together. Now, those are hardly fair examples for the industry, as GE is one of the few brands with pockets deep enough to pull off that roster. But it is a reminder that exciting campaigns are still all about the content, not the tech. Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PUB00000Ag4Dq02AWE0> .

Acxiom Connects

Acxiom’s Connectivity unit (That’s LiveRamp!) led off the marketing data giant’s Q2 with a 65% YoY increase, to $22 million. Gross margins in Connectivity also shot way up, from 19% to 62%. Don’t expect that to last, however, as Acxiom is explicitly in “investment mode,” meaning it’ll toss money where it sees opportunity, which might affect those margins. Connectivity also oversaw $82 million in gross media spend in Q2. Acxiom’s Marketing Services and Audience Solutions unit (which will split in Q3) didn’t fare quite as well at $185 million, down 3% YoY. However, in the US that revenue was up 2% YoY to $168 million. In total, Acxiom’s Q2 revenue was $207 million, up 2% YoY. Check out the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40F0A2g0BVLD0WAP00q0A0> .

FIN And Tech vs. FinTech

A new lobbying group, Financial Innovation Now (FIN), combines the efforts of rivals like Google, Amazon, Apple, eBay and Intuit to represent new technology in policy debates over financial security and regulations. The statement from FIN President Brian Peters said, “A technological transformation is going to make financial services more accessible, more affordable and more secure.” Mobile payment leaders know they need to up their game in DC.

News Round Up

YouTube Welcomes Moat Et Al

Google has opened the door to third-party viewability measurement on YouTube. Moat, Integral Ad Science, comScore and DoubleVerify have all been approved to track campaigns on the video platform, beginning in early 2016. The move follows a similar concession by Facebook last month. Commenting for a DoubleClick blog post, Unilever CMO Keith Weed said, “This move will generate better industry-wide standards across viewability and third party verification practices and continues the momentum in the right direction."  <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0EAA00RdD0AP00040> Read more.

Ad Fraud’s Newest (Old) Needle

WhiteOps and Forensiq tell The Wall Street Journal they have seen a slight lift in ad injection schemes. Google has waged its own campaign <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqSB0A2LW004D0P0AAF0d00>  against ad injection, saying the practice is more dangerous than industry observers give it credit for. WhiteOps CEO Michael Tiffany says, “I don’t think most publishers have caught on to the way they’re being victimized.” Ad injection was among the original ad tech bogeymen. The last time ad injection was in the news, in 2012 <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0dWD0LT000B4000AG> , Sambreel was the big perpetrator via browser plugins that dropped ads on About.com, The New York Times and others.

Candy Crushing It

Activision Blizzard, one of the world’s largest video game companies, purchased the mobile game publisher King Digital (best known for Candy Crush) for $5.9 billion, reports Christopher Palmeri at Bloomberg. The acquisition comes as other gaming titans, including Nintendo, are pivoting <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LdI2VADP0A00A0>  into the mobile sphere. The big money is still in the hardware and traditional video game systems, but mobile is catching up as apps figure out how to monetize. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02J000Wd00APW04DABAqL0> .

Danger: Hard Hat Area

Amazon is set to open its first permanent retail location, a book shop in a Seattle mall where a Barnes & Nobles once stood. So it goes. Walmart has recently claimed its physical infrastructure is a differentiating advantage over Amazon, which the ecommerce powerhouse appears to have taken as a challenge. Richard Macauley writes for Quartz that Amazon’s in-store inventory will be “selected by a mixture of big data algorithms and human curators,” and is one part of a larger effort to build a real-world shopping, shipping and delivery chain. Google, on the other hand, <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWL400Y0ABD00d0AL02P0Aq>  just killed its first brick-and-mortar push. So it goes. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/TZ0Wd0P0A000DBM20L4qAA0> .

Commission Junction Automates Some Functions

Affiliate marketing company Commission Junction (owned by Conversant, owned by Epsilon, owned by Alliance Data Systems) has activated its Placements Marketplace, designed to automate some of the manual processes for buying and selling media in affiliate channels.The tool was developed to help buyers plan and measure their buys, allowing them to search for inventory based on format, publisher, seasonal events or KPIs.

Carson’s Facebook presence, Eleventy Marketing Group's Ken Dawson said, became the top of a lead-gen funnel. It’s an approach more reminiscent of brand marketing than most modern campaigns: "We have Facebook as the top of the sales funnel … and we quickly move to convert them into donors or supporters."

News Round Up

WPP Eyes Essence

The Wall Street Journal reports WPP Group is in talks to buy 10-year-old Essence Digital, a fast-growing digital agency with strong programmatic chops. Essence’s No. 1 client is Google, but the agency has been working to diversify its client base with some success. Two years ago, Essence bought Seattle agency Point Reach and brought on EA’s Oscar Garza to run its automated buying operation.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0AAAQ0DI800> Read on.

The Publisher Lot

Digital media players like Business Insider and BuzzFeed have grown into scaled, general-news publications. Is that still a viable path for young publishers, or is the future all about specialization? Atlantic Media COO Michael Finnegan says pubs shouldn’t step into the ring with Facebook. “One of the ways to ensure that you’re not competing with them too much is to pinpoint areas of expertise where you can connect with your audience directly and offer something unique.” More at Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/GAB0A820DR4JW0AL0000P0q> .

Pandora’s New Crown Jewel

Pandora has locked up an exclusive streaming distribution deal with “Serial” for the podcast’s second season, according to a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABL8WK0APAS020qD40>  from company co-founder Tim Westergren. Sponsors haven’t been named, but Pandora says it has two brands teed up to take over from MailChimp, the first season’s sponsor. The deal also gives Pandora rights to stream “This American Life” (which when “Serial” isn’t running is the country’s most popular podcast).

The Next Generation

Speaking of content, CBS’s first digital-first series is a “Star Trek” show modeled on the original, but targeted at an online-only audience. CBS hasn’t published a tally of its All Access subscribers, but it’s clear that competing with streaming services that have strong original content is a tough proposition (even from a $6-per-month price point). All Access does have ads, though, so subscriptions aren’t life or death. We’ll see if the big investment in original programming pays off on CBS’s first digital spin.

News Round Up

The Surging App

Nike will heavily leverage app-based ads in its bid to grow ecommerce sales from $1 billion to $7 billion within five years. The company has kicked off a pricey campaign that includes considerable weather-targeting initiatives for its various products, according to Sydney Ember at The New York Times. “Advertisers are absolutely interested in apps because apps have higher engagement rates in terms of consumers interacting with brands on a mobile device,” testifies Xaxis CEO Brian Lesser. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00PWqA000AP5A0U040D2L> .

Lowering The Drawbridge

Among the vendors anointed by the MRC to measure desktop ad viewability, Moat just became the first to get the same stamp of approval to track mobile viewability. CEO Jonah Goodhart said he thinks the change will nudge advertisers into mobile spending, as confidence builds that ads are being viewed (and not infuriating users). The MRC on the other hand can anticipate a barrage of emails from measurement vendors who probably aren’t keen on Moat being the only player with certification. Read more from Mike Shields at the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBV000A5A0A200WL4qPQ00> .

For Brands, It’s A Snap

Snapchat is moving beyond native brand posts, and will now allow brands to provide graphics that users can insert into their “snaps,” reports Tim Peterson for Ad Age. The first advertiser to use it is 20th Century Fox, which is providing using images from “The Peanuts Movie” for people to insert into their posts. Using body and facial recognition technology, the sponsored lenses can actually interact with and wrap around pictures people post of themselves. Snapchat also just gave its first brand direct access to the Discover publisher portal. The money is rolling, though time will tell if there’s any user pushback on the new marketing infiltration. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0A005qWR> .

Sharing Is Caring

It’s hard for the likes of online video and TV providers (HBO, Netflix, cable companies, etc.) to crack down on password sharing, as users may have legitimate reasons for access across many IPs, or who share within a family. But Charter CEO Tom Rutledge came out swinging against the practice in the company’s earnings call last week, writes Shalini Ramachandran at the WSJ. Rutledge attacked networks like HBO whose push for “TV Everywhere” has not corresponded with a rise in measurement and controls over who accesses the content – and who pays.
