 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic Pop 

Interpublic Group's media investment arm, Magna Global, estimates media investments in programmatic will rise 50% this year to $21 billion. AdAge picks it up <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00wWqA000bPKA0R040D2L> : "By 2018, only the most premium digital inventory, including sponsorship and full-episode video, among other non-standard formats, will still be transacted through traditional means." A good question: What’s included in the definition of programmatic? RTB only? Private auctions? Workflow automation? IPG beats the gong. 

NBC Evolution 

NBCUniversal is the latest TV network player to dabble in programmatic sales of digital inventory. It has unveiled a private marketplace, NBCUx, that will expose its online display, mobile and video inventory to its top advertisers. Krishan Bhatia, NBCU’s EVP of digital ad sales, called the decision “an evolution.” But, infrastructure problems stand in the way of true programmatic television. “As technology enables greater programmatic access to TV inventory, we will be embracing that.” More via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DxA02000BWK0q4bSLP0A> . 

Seats For All 

More agencies are wrapping their heads around programmatic, leading to more relationships for the exchange players. Case in point: Rubicon Project has added Publicis Groupe agency DigitasLBi to its Buyer Cloud Platform, even though the SSP already has a relationship with the holding company’s VivaKi trading desk. "The needs of our clients are constantly changing as they search for better ways to reach audiences," said Baba Shetty, DigitasLBi’s chief strategy and media officer. Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0yK0Lb0DB0T0W0q4P20A0A>  

Let ‘Er Rep 

Cox Media Group, which acquired and eventually shuttered <http://go.adexchanger.com/iUKW00BbPzL00A000Dq2A04>  ad tech company Adify, will take another stab at programmatic. A new company called Gamut will support exchange-traded media alongside its sales representation services housed under its CoxReps division. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00V0AL0KW00AD2q0bA04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

ID Wars 

Quartz reporter Leo Mirani details the trajectory of Google and Facebook’s crusade for login data. “As mobile phones and tablets render old tracking mechanisms, such as cookies, increasingly ineffectual, identity is becoming the single most important tool to follow web users across multiple devices,” he writes. Significantly, Mirani adds that “[b]etween them, Facebook and Google account for over 80% of social log-ins, according to Janrain, a company that helps manage social login integration. The gap between the two and everybody else is gradually widening.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/qbAW0A0DLE004G02B0Pn00q> . 

Hello Ello 

The new hotness in digital platforms is Ello, a social site that’s staking its future on consumer resistance to ad tracking. In its manifesto <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBF000AGb0A200WL4qPo00> , Ello points out that on other social platforms, “Every post you share, every friend you make, and every link you follow is tracked, recorded, and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads.” But the past few years are littered with the bodies of Facebook alternatives. More on CNET <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PGB00000AG4Dq02bWp0> . 

BitTorrent, Brand Safe? 

BitTorrent, historically associated with piracy, introduced a new paygate feature that lets publishers sell bundles of digital content. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke was the face of the release, making his solo album available for $6. TechCrunch has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0qGbWPH0A00> . The pro-musician move comes as BitTorrent seeks to position itself as a legit place for premium advertising, as Digiday reported earlier this month <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pr40G0DIAbq2> . 

Native GIFs 

Native’s getting a mini-GIF makeover via digital image platform Imgur, Adweek reported on  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0bJA0000q0Ds20LAWG> Friday. Through a limited number of branded campaigns, the company claims it can score engagement rates between 1 and 4%. (In this context engagement translates to number of likes, comments and shares.) Imgur COO Matt Strader said, "From a native advertising aspect, the essence of that experience works great on the Web and great with mobile—and the impact just grows more and more over time.” 

Yahoo-AOL Merger Revisited 

Activist investor Starboard is clamoring for a marriage between Yahoo and AOL, and with Yahoo’s cash infusion related to the Alibaba IPO, it might just be possible. But is it a good idea? Reuters notes that AOL’s ad stack, in particular Adap.tv, “could fit well with Yahoo's recent efforts to deliver more online video programming, such as videos about technology and fashion, along with old episodes of the Saturday Night Live television program.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4G0K0P00qD002LBW0tAb>  Yahoo’s content, AOL’s tech!

Nikesh Wants Content 

Former Google exec Nikesh Arora is circling the wagons around content in his new role as CEO of SoftBank Internet and Media <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0GA0DB0Wv2Lq00bA00M4P0> .  The Hollywood Reporter says that SoftBank is “in talks” to buy DreamWorks Animation for $3.4 billion. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02w000NG00bPW04DABAqL0> . Arora has $60 billion to potentially play with in that SoftBank was an early investor in Alibaba.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Breaking The Login 

Privacy regulators in Europe have suggested Google switch off matching of users across its services such as Gmail, Google Docs and YouTube. The request was part of a set of guidelines written by privacy regulators in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands. In reply to the six-page letter, a Google spokesperson said, “We're always open to feedback and look forward to further discussions on these recommendations.” The  <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPbb4B00W000qAB0020AnD> WSJ has more. 

Cross-Device Forecast 

“We are a data company,” The Weather Channel’s global yield and programmatic director, Daniel Young, told Beet.TV. “We enrich an advertising offering whether it is on app, on the mobile web or the web itself.” Young added that one of The Weather Channel’s highest areas of growth is mobile. However! “We have good traction and reach across other [areas]. We’re developing all our products to be able to sell advertising … across all platforms seamlessly.” The cross-device storm rages on.

VivaKi Quality Check 

On Thursday, VivaKi broke the seal on its Quality Index, which will vet all placements of media bought programmatically. The new solution pools data from comScore, Integral Ad Science and a number of DSPs for side-by-side inventory comparisons. “There are so many inventory options available that marketers are continuously plagued by quality issues and unsure of what metrics and vehicles will ensure that their ad is seen," said VivaKi’s EVP for global solutions, Doug Kofoid. "Further, the tools for assessing performance are disparate and not aligned. This is an area we want to deliver on for our clients.” Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0B0P4qA02000WLd0p0AbDB> . 

Marketing Tech, Tech Marketing 

An IDC survey predicts marketing budgets at tech companies will jump 3.5% this year, and their revenues will increase 3.7%. The research firm’s Rich Vancil added, “For third-platform companies [cloud, mobility, social business and analytics], revenue growth and marketing budget growth is growing at 10% to 20%. ... This is where all the action is in terms of budgets.” Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/ue0000DB4L0A0q02BPqWAb0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Pubs Plug Facebook Leaks 

Publishers and retailers are quietly rejecting the Facebook code that tracks users across the internet, the WSJ’s Reed Albergotti reports. Web traffic experts at Ghostery told the Journal that since the spring, they've seen Facebook's code less often on sites like The New York Times, Airbnb, Williams-Sonoma and A&F. Ghostery CEO Scott Meyer said it could be that publishers and retailers want to restrict Facebook’s access to their data. “[Online publishers are] sharing their entire audience back to Facebook and what are they getting for it? I can pretty much guarantee that the value publishers are getting from that is not worth it,” added John Strabley, director of strategy for Quaero. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0bVA0000q0DP20LAWv> . 

Northern Migration 

Mirroring a similar move in July, when AOL UK automated its reserved inventory, AOL Canada made 100% of its display, video and mobile inventory available to Canadian advertisers for purchase programmatically on Wednesday. Accuen is a launch partner and will manage inventory sale, which includes premium formats, across AOL's owned and operated Canadian sites, including The Huffington Post Canada, Autoblog Canada, and StyleList Canada. What's more, AOL added a premium mobile unit to its programmatic lineup earlier this month <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0vA0DB0WQ2Lq00bA00W4P0> . Programmatic’s making waves, eh? Read the press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0RX02q0L0AB0Db00Av4>  

Native Juices Flowing 

Juice, a mobile-only monetization company, is joining forces with Twitter to offer programmatic native app advertising through the MoPub exchange. “Native can be kind of clunky, and when brands get into the nitty gritty of what’s actually necessary to do it, there’s not a whole lot of efficiency,” CEO and President Neil Sweeney told AdExchanger. “We’re doing this because it’s programmatic and not a make-work manual process.” Two brands have already signed up for the service, with several others on the way. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/lvBqY000LbDP0A2A4000S0W> . 

Search Engine Success 

Online survey company Qualtrics just raised a notable $150 million in venture capital, which CEO Ryan Smith said the company will use to expand overseas. Qualtrics’ clients include MasterCard, Kellogg's, Southwest Air, Lands' End and the Weather Channel, and the company touts "fast data” in the name of real-time decisioning. Go here for the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000Z2040qAbLPDBvT0WA0>  and read an AdExchanger Qualtrics case study <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB0000Avb0A200WL4qPU00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Under The Radar 

On Tuesday Nielsen and Simulmedia unveiled a research partnership that rolls together Nielsen’s people meter with Simulmedia's set-top box data. The pair-up will allow the companies to measure niche cable networks that typically fly under Nielsen's ratings. Simulmedia CEO Dave Morgan said the findings could benefit network TV buyers. "This research will surface both the value of these networks and their audiences to brands, and the cost effectiveness of working with them to reach attractive consumers and achieve positive business outcomes.” Broadcasting  <http://go.adexchanger.com/GbB0Ar20Da48W0AL0000P0q> & Cable has more. 

Atlas Plugged 

Facebook is close to rolling out a revamped version of its Atlas demand-side ad server. Word on the street is the secret sauce of the rebuilt solution is a cross-device ID that leverages Facebook's direct relationships with its users. WSJ writes about it, citing one ad executive who says, "People spend more time on mobile than on desktop, but marketers don't spend there because cookies don't work. … This could finally enable us to spend more money in mobile." All hail the login. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/g90D40L0q20bBA0AW000brP> . 

Scrap ’N Track 

Pinterest began testing Promoted Pins <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0arbWPc0A00>  with a handful of advertisers in May, and will purportedly layer on ad-targeting capabilities when the offering debuts in earnest next month. A privacy policy update references conversion tracking and audience targeting of a company’s existing customers on the platform. A spokesman tells Ad Age, "We feel both features will help our partners understand how the ads impact their business and also make Promoted Pins even more relevant to Pinners." Pinterest’s updated privacy policy <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0b00rqdb>  says pinners will have the option to opt out. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pc40r0DeAbq2> . 

Buy American 

GroupM acquired a 49% stake in marketing media company Haworth on Tuesday, according to a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PfB00000Ar4Dq02bWd0>  from holding company WPP Group. Haworth manages media investments for a number of top-tier business and bands, among them Target, Ben & Jerry's, DreamWorks Animation and the Oscars. The release states that the “investment continues WPP's strategy of investing in important markets such as the United States where WPP companies (including associates) collectively generate revenues of over US$6 billion and employ approximately 25,000 people.” More power, and data, to the holdco. 

Programmatic Beachfront 

Video ad tech player Beachfront Media, whose client list includes CBS and Hulu, is getting into mobile programmatic. Well, who isn’t these days <http://go.adexchanger.com/qbAW0A0DL6004r02B0P400q> ? Beachfront Media CEO Frank Sinton told MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tg0Wr0P0b000DBe20L4qAA0>  there’s “a strong need in the marketplace to help people monetize their in-app mobile video views.” Sinton said Beachfront’s new offering stands out from the likes of Adapt.tv or LiveRail because it’s specifically designed for apps.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Advising On Programmatic 

MediaLink has roped in Matt Spiegel to lead its push into programmatic consulting. Spiegel, a former Omnicom and Mediamath exec, struck out on his own back in March with an advisory practice he called Concept Corridor. AdExchanger story. <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0bk0Lb0DB060W0q4P20A0A>  He tells AdAge, “We started using the term programmatic in 2009. Eyes glazed over. Many still don't know what it means. It has a definition that's unclear. But say the word and everyone wants to listen and talk about it.” Already, MediaLink is advising 10 clients on automation. The industry hungers for programmatic guidance. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/GbB0Ak20D74cW0AL0000P0q> . 

Tim Cook Vs. Data 

Data seems like a dirty word to Tim Cook. In a lengthy interview with Bloomberg <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0kWD0L8000B4000bd> , the Apple CEO declares that Apple Pay will succeed where other mobile payment solutions have failed – or at least failed to gain traction – because others didn’t focus enough on the user experience. “I think most of the other people that ventured into this spent all of their time on the front end thinking about how to create a business model, how to collect data, own the data, sell the data, monetize the data.” Perhaps true. Also true: Apple Watches come complete with NFC. In other words, as Business Insider reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0ekbWP90A00> , there will be tracking. 

Serving The Publisher 

Pinterest has tapped former Google media relations manager Robert Macdonald to deepen the company’s ties to digital and print publications. “We don’t think we’ve invested enough yet to totally capture the opportunity and to help these publishers,” Pinterest’s Joanne Bradford told The New York Times. “They make a lot of quality content that pinners are very passionate about.” Pinterest’s future network? Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0fa02q0L0AB0Db00Ak4> . 

Social Migration? 

Though Facebook's ever-changing algorithm tends to irk brands, it's still king of social media platforms. But according to an unnamed agency that spoke to Adweek, brand clients are migrating away from Facebook in "dramatic numbers," and are heading to other social channels and micro sites for their marketing needs. "Brands don’t own what happens on Facebook," commented Forrester analyst Nate Elliott, "and as organic reach has been absolutely eviscerated, they remain aware of that." Organic or get out? Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PbBgD000qA2k04L0b> . 

Data For All 

UK-based ecommerce platform Ometria is on a mission to help online retailers compete with the big dogs… using data. "Better data makes for better decisions and it’s here that tech giants such as Amazon have traditionally had a data-driven advantage over smaller e-commerce businesses," writes TechCrunch reporter Steve O'Hear, "which is precisely what Ometria is trying to change." Ometria will use a $500,000 injection to build out predictive modeling and automated consumer communication. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0bc0B4L0h2AAP00q0Dk00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

In-House Grouse 

The trend of marketers managing programmatic spend in-house is "a temporary phenomenon,” according to WPP Group CEO Martin Sorrell. In the wake of an AdExchanger Research report tracking momentum for self-sufficient media buying, Sorrell told WSJ, “Our view is after a year or two it will change. I question whether [clients] will be able to apply technology successfully.” AdExchanger Director of Research Joanna O'Connell sees it differently: “Marketers’ hands are being forced because of the way holding companies and agencies are behaving.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/leBqE000LbDP0A2A4000P0W> 

Empire Strikes Back 

Shortly after Tim Cook posted updates to Apple’s privacy policy on Thursday, which read like a dig at Google <http://go.adexchanger.com/uQ0000DB4L0A0F02ePqWAb0> , the search company issued some privacy updates of its own. "For over three years, Android has offered encryption, and keys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement,” said Google spokeswoman Niki Christoff. Default encryption on smartphones will block advertisers’ access to data, but also boxes out the government. The tech giants’ relationship with big brother: “It’s complicated.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0e0P4qA02000WLR0G0AbDB> . 

Blurring Lines 

The relationship between marketing and sales is changing, due in large part to tech and quantifiable metrics, says Cisco CMO Blair Christie. "Now, there's information about the customer going on all around us. Over two-thirds of the process for a customer happens before they ever talk to the company. And all that information, the marketing organization has," Christie told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00H0SL0eW00AD2q0bA04> , adding that "marketing and sales can be more complementary than ever before." CMO rising. 

Automate The Image 

In-image ad company GumGum is automating its inventory offerings, Adweek reported Friday, and Xaxis is a demand-side partner. "Advertisers can develop [our] rich-media units according to our specifications, or we can build them using an agency’s creative assets," explained GumGum CEO Per Ophir Tanz. "We’ll also be able to develop custom creative internally that can be used for in-image campaigns,” added Xaxis NA Managing Director Brian Gleason. “We’ll then be able to apply third-party tracking to capture standard [performance] metrics."

Marchex Falling 

Shares of Marchex took a sizable hit late last week, falling nearly 46% following a revised agreement with Allstate. Allstate uses Marchex's call analytics tech, which gives advertisers insights into which formats, keywords and channels drive phone calls. Allstate purportedly wanted to move to a fixed payment plan, but Marchex was not down with that. "Marchex doesn’t believe it’s in our best long-term interests to work under such an arrangement,” Marchex CEO Russell Horowitz said.

Tracking Pin-tent 

Pinterest shared that starting Oct. 19, the scrapbooking site will start serving "more relevant" posts. "We want to help advertisers better understand how their Promoted Pins are doing," the company explained. "For example, an advertiser may want to know how often their ads are showing on Pinterest or how many people bought a product after clicking on a Promoted Pin. In the future, we’ll report that info to them." To do so, Pinterest will be collecting and logging cookie data and device information. How scrappy.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook, Money Magnet

Facebook now attracts a greater percentage of ad spend than it does attention minutes, according to an eMarketer report <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q05A0DB0Wv2Lq00bA00b4P0> . Nearly 10% of US digital ad spend in the US goes to Facebook, but the company only draws 7% of adult time spent on digital media. “While the cost of Google ads has dropped, Facebook ad prices continue to rise,” writes The Wall Street Journal’s Reed Albergotti. “How long advertisers’ exuberance for Facebook will last – whether it can turn into a permanent fixture in the digital advertising landscape like Google – is the question.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBc000A5b0A200WL4qPw00> .

Alibaba Day

On the eve of Alibaba’s big IPO, Re/code's Jason Del Rey muses on the company’s intentions for the US market and concludes it’s not super keen on selling to Americans. However! The company is “cutting deals with U.S. e-commerce and payments companies such as ShopRunner, Fanatics and Stripe, in an attempt to make it easier for American brands to sell to Chinese shoppers.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/l5Bqd000LbDP0A2A4000x0W> . Follow the audience.

Spy Vs. Spy

Yandex increased sales to foreign advertisers tenfold over the course of two years, to $85 million in 2013, according to Bloomberg. That should give Google pause. “Good-quality services including search, online taxi and maps with real-time traffic jams allow Yandex to retain its loyal users,” said UralSib Capital analyst Konstantin Belov. “Still, its leadership isn’t guaranteed long term because the Internet environment is very dynamic. For instance, Google has a strong influence on Android-powered phones.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q05WD0Le000B4000by> .

Embrace The Data

Speaking to The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqfB0b2LW004D0P0AAz0500>  at DMEXCO, Mondelez VP of global media Bonin Bough shared some observations on programmatic. "When it comes to the element programmatic is playing in [the advertising] ecosystem, I think it has a bad rep,” he said. “A lot of people see it as a cost-saving effort, but from our point of view it’s very much a data opportunity and we think there is a data arms race in front of us." Identifying emerging technologies will be key for brands with the impending Internet of Things, he said.

Swrving Into View

Swrve has raised $10M to support its bet on mobile marketing automation and the transactional future of the smartphone. “As our conventional understanding of ‘e-commerce’ becomes increasingly obsolete and more and more consumers conduct business via mobile devices, it is platforms like Swrve that will control and grow the consumer relationship,” CEO Christopher Dean tells VentureBeat. Already, the company works with more than 100 firms that use Swrve to mine data on their best users. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DW54bA00gL0PB0A2> .

Hurd ’N Catz At Oracle

Oracle’s executive landscape shifted significantly Thursday, when the company revealed Larry Ellison had stepped down <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqiB0b2LW004D0P0AAC0500>  from his CEO position. He’ll be CTO and executive chairman. Presidents Mark Hurd and Safra Catz (who is also Oracle’s CFO and will remain so) will both have the CEO title. Separately, Oracle reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00b0D50WjDP0L0A00>  total revenues at $8.6 billion, a 3% YoY increase. Combined revenue from its software and cloud businesses grew 6%, to $6.6 billion.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Dentsu Buys Covario

Dentsu Aegis Network has acquired search and content marketing agency Covario. Convario's Rio SEO software offers tools for local and enterprise search, social media automation and analytics. “As points of engagement and transaction come closer together, it is crucial for our clients to have a dominant position in all key areas of the consumer journey,” said Dentsu CEO Nigel Morris.

Programmatic For Brands

Marketers looking at programmatic have several models to choose from, says a report from AdExchanger Research. WSJ picks it up: "Trading desks have proved a bright spot for holding companies over the past few years, as marketers have steadily increased their spending through automated ad systems. But the opaque practices and pricing models of some of these agency groups have recently led marketers to question how their money is being spent, and in some cases to shun the groups completely in favor of building their in-house alternatives."

Live Impressions

Pandora is leveraging its user data to ensure marketers reach their target audience at a series of concerts, according to Adweek. Though the shows are open to the public, Pandora is curating the audience using user data such as age, gender and music preferences, and is phoning and emailing invites to listeners most likely to engage with Lexus’ brand. "Data and the targeting it enables is transforming the media-buying process," Pandora CMO Simon Fleming-Wood said. But he cautioned "there are watchouts along the way. Not all data is created equal."

Inside HuffPo

Speaking to Digiday, Arianna Huffington touched on traffic, Facebook’s algorithms and measurement, but also on HuffPo's changing identity. What about deep reporting and hard-nosed journalism, Digiday's Lucia Moses wanted to know. "It’s our job to put the spotlight on good things,” Huffington said, “because a lot of brands like to advertise sections around causes, whether it’s Goldman Sachs or Johnson & Johnson or Chipotle. This is very much in our DNA and is also a great revenue source.” Huffington added that a year from now, the publication will look to include long- and short-form video, and more on mobile.

An Apple A Day

Something’s amiss with Apple’s HealthKit apps, the Financial Times reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02K000jZ00aPW04DABAqL0>  Wednesday. In a statement, Apple explained, “We discovered a bug that prevents us from making HealthKit apps available on iOS 8 today. We’re working quickly to have the bug fixed in a software update and have HealthKit apps available by the end of the month.” Apple previously updated its policy on the health care data it collects, prohibiting the reselling of data for advertising purposes, read AdExchanger’s coverage on that <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPaL0Zq0AD00B4k020W0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Does Apple Care? 

CEO Tim Cook draws a hard line between Apple’s mission and other companies that plumb for data. In a TV interview with Charlie Rose, he said, “Our business is not based on having information about you. You’re not our product. Our products are these, and this watch, and Macs and so forth. And so we run a very different company.” Insert frowny face for any marketer hoping to leverage Apple Pay transaction data for attribution modeling. Read more via Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LUo2SADP0a00A0>  and watch the clip <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00Up0ALAWPTaB02q000> . 

TV Troubles 

TV ad spend grew a meager 5% in the second quarter, while digital increased 6.2%, according to data from Kantar <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPaq4B00W000qAU0020AUD> . Several of the nation's biggest advertisers cut spending on traditional media and online display. P&G, for example, reduced spend in both those categories by 17%. But TV chiefs were hesitant to admit a definitive shift to digital. "I do think it's mostly the economy at its core," Fox President Chase Carey said. "You've got a view that people have a lack of confidence in the economy, and advertisers would like to make decisions on shorter time frames, which means scatter." The WSJ has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/GaB0AU20DV4rW0AL0000P0q> . 

Rebranding Radio 

Clear Channel first introduced its iHeartRadio app in 2008, now home to some 800 of the company's radio stations. Now it has adopted that app’s name, becoming IHeartMedia. It’s all about projecting digital DNA. "Any significant growth in radio ... is likely to come from the digital side," writes the NYT's Ben Sisario, citing eMarketer findings that "revenue from broadcast radio will remain essentially flat through 2018, at about $15.6 billion, while digital sales will gain more than 160 percent during that time, to $5.3 billion.” Gone are the days Clear Channel was feared as a media monopolist.

Synapse Fires 

Multiscreen audience platform Adbrain has officially launched a self-serve DSP (more info <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0UWD0LX000B4000at> ). Launch partners on the platform, dubbed Synapse, include M&C Saatchi Mobile, Fetch and Omnicom Media Group. Adbrain CEO Gareth Davies sat down with AdExchanger in August to talk about the challenges of migrating clients from managed service to self-serve. Read that interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqYB0a2LW004D0P0AAu0U00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Voice From The Cloud

Oracle CEO Larry Ellison speaks publicly and at length about the marketing tech opportunity his company is chasing with the rat-a-tat acquisitions of Eloqua, Vitrue, Responsys and BlueKai. Speaking to Ad Age, Ellison says, “The CMO's role is going to be more important next year than it is this year, and more important the year after that."

Weather Data For Sale

The buyout firms that own The Weather Channel have yet to formally hire a bank, but Bloomberg reports that they're eyeing JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to evaluate strategic options. “The private-equity firms are interested in exploring the idea of selling all or part of the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. They also may decide to hold their ownership stakes rather than sell, the people said." The Weather Company holds the keys to troves of location and, naturally, weather data.

Tracking Shares

On Monday, Bitly struck a partnership with Adobe to better track site-site conversions that originate from social interactions. "As a Bitly Certified Partner, we can provide Adobe Social customers with a deeper understanding of how their Bitly links are contributing to impressions, traffic, and conversion on digital properties so they can optimize their social content campaigns," said Adobe’s Craig Stoe. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00MA0L0Dp00aB2qW0ALP04> .

Flipboard’s Ad Plan

Video ads are coming to Flipboard. CEO Mike McCue first revealed the digital publication’s decision to incorporate video last month at a tech event hosted by ReadWrite in San Francisco. Unlike Facebook's video ads, users have to engage with spots for the ads to play. Also noteworthily, Flipboard will not charge a premium. "Clever," writes Re/code senior editor Peter Kafka, "since one of the main reason digital publishers are gaga about video ads is that they can charge higher prices for them."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook Mechanics 

A BuzzFeed story looks at the thinking behind Facebook’s ad delivery. The company uses targeting data, including its own interest data, “to quickly whittle away the number of ads that are relevant to a specific user to between 5,000 and 7,000 ads. At this point, the job is only around halfway done.” The ultimate decision rests on a combination of factors, including ad quality and, of course, bid price. “Higher quality ads — whether that’s good video, high-fidelity photos, or ads that attract a lot of likes and comments — cost less to be ranked higher in News Feed.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0aAAd0DXG00>  

Desk Defense 

It would be interesting to see a major publisher or advertiser mount a spirited endorsement of the trading desk model. For now we’ll have to settle for one of its key global leaders, VivaKi AOD’s Marco Bertozzi, who writes in a think piece for the WSJ, “I submit that an in-house option or managed service demand-side platform that buys on a marketer’s behalf will provide less brand safety than an agency trading desk. It simply costs too much to deliver extensive black and white lists, tech vetting and human vetting at a client level.“ Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Te0WG0P0a000DBY20L4qAA0>  

Google Hires Another Customer 

Continuing its recent trend of tapping brand execs for lead advertising roles, Google grabbed former P&G NA Marketing Director Julie Eddleman. Eddleman will serve as global client leader and "joins a team that includes fellow P&G executive Kirk Perry, now Google's president-brand solutions.” Ad Age story <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPaZ4B00W000qAG0020AfD> . Go here <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0aAAh0D0H00>  for an AdExchanger-compiled list of Google's recent hires from the brand side. 

1Up Media 

Facebook bought Oculus, YouTube bought Twitch, Microsoft wants to buy Mojang and gaming took a prominent place at Apple’s product release last Tuesday. What’s going on? "The video games industry is one of the most widely misunderstood components of the modern media landscape," wrote Digiday's Eric Blattberg on Friday. "Some brands are capitalizing on the ubiquitous medium and the passionate culture that sounds it, but more are flailing blindly or ignoring the industry entirely." Industry execs, brands: Get in the game. Read how <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4H0i0P00qD002LBW01Aa> . 

Machine-rrific 

Exchange-traded media is the “it girl” of the media business, and The Economist further proves it with a big feature. "The rise of real-time bidding is important because it offers a glimpse of how other ad-supported media may change over time. As more devices, including television sets, radio and outdoor billboards, become internet-equipped, a market for advertising space that can be bid for will spread to other industries, eventually even to television.” All in good time.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Yandex Buys Ad Tech 

Russian Internet giant Yandex acquired ADFOX, a company that provides planning, managerial and analytics services for in-banner, mobile and video internet ad campaigns. In June, ADFOX’s chief development officer, Boris Omelnitskiy, told AdExchanger <http://go.adexchanger.com/yawWDqP00A0LABX04300020> , “We work mostly on the sell side and many of the independent publishing players in Russia are among our clients, because Yandex, Mail.ru and Google all have their own ad technology.” Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4w040P00qD002LBW0YAa> . 

Taking The Heat 

Hiro-Media.com’s sales director, Brian Jacobs, tackles trading desk transparency in a piece for MyersBizNet. Though Xaxis has been clear, "or clear-ish," Jacobs says others like Accuen "are still something of a mystery. It's almost as if the others are happy to sit back and let Xaxis cop the flack." Insisting on transparency, Jacobs adds, "If agencies were serious about business partnerships and about being paid accordingly they would come clean about the unofficial or non-transparent income they make.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWw4aA005L0PB0Z2> . 

Apple’s Privacy Challenge 

In the wake of Apple's product release, the NYT's Brian Chen and Steve Lohr consider the inherent privacy challenges of Apple Pay and smartwatch. But Apple's dead clear about not storing payment data on devices or on Apple's servers. At the release on Tuesday, Apple CEO Timothy Cook said, “We’re not looking at it through the lens that most people do of wanting to know what you’re buying, where you buy it at, how much you’re spending and all these kinds of things.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000x20a0L0B07A4PDAq> . 

Data-Driven Change 

In a special report on advertising and technology from The Economist, Alexandra Suich writes, “Technology is profoundly changing the dynamics of advertising. Building on the vast amount of data produced by consumers’ digital lives, it is giving more power to media companies that have a direct relationship with their customers and can track them across different devices.” She adds, “An entire industry has sprung up around targeted ads.” The Economist joins the ranks of publishers who are paying attention to ad tech. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP01802q0L0AB0Da00Ax4> . 

Facebook Ad UX 

Facebook is asking users for more detailed feedback on the ads they see, and will use that info to increase relevancy. “Most advertisers will see no change to the delivery of their ads or how their ads perform on Facebook,” reads the post. “These updates are designed to affect the ads that a small set of people give us negative feedback on, and allow us to show people ads that we think are most relevant for them, and make sure advertisers are getting their messages in front of the right people.” It’s about the ad experience, not the algorithm.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Reform! 

360i President Jared Belsky calls for programmatic reform in a column for AdAge, citing confusion about automation, opaque operating models and a general lack of integration. "Agencies are in the business of being trusted advisors," he says. "Current programmatic models aren't designed around this trusted advisor theory, which is leading more marketers to consider taking programmatic inhouse. This can be a daunting and challenging undertaking for most brands, as programmatic talent can be very costly and the capital investment around this model is very real.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000q2Pa0L0B0PA4PDAq> . 

Playing Politics 

The Romney/Ryan campaign failed in its 2012 presidential bid, but its campaign donor list lives on. Targeted Victory and its self-service arm, Targeted Engagement, are giving its users access to that dataset through a political audience exchange. “It’s a fundraising arms race” out there, Targeted Victory co-founder Michael Beach told AdExchanger. “We’re licensing this data and making it available again. … Even if you’re running for dog catcher somewhere, you’ll have access, and that’s something that’s never been done on the right or the left before.” Details  <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0Qq0La0DB0Q0W0q4P20A0A> here. 

Androids In India 

Mobile advertising is booming in the Asia-Pacific market. The region has seen 70% year-over-year growth in mobile ad impressions, according to new research from Opera Mediaworks. The report [get it <http://go.adexchanger.com/Aq0R04WB200AaPq00L0R0DA> ] also found that India is the biggest driver of mobile ad impressions in APAC – up 260% since July 2013 – a trend driven largely by the country’s rapid shift from feature phones to smart devices. Of that, Android’s share is an impressive 41.7% to iOS’s tiny .04%.More on that <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00qS0ALAWPSaB02q000> . 

Europe’s Mad For Programmatic Video 

Ad spend across the pond is rapidly shifting to digital video, according to Adap.tv's “European State of the Video Industry” report. “With the advent of new data-driven practices – including the rapid adoption of private marketplaces and the growth of programmatic TV – there are new opportunities (and obstacles) that advertisers, agencies and publishers must understand in order to continue to capitalise on consumer demand for video,” reads the report. Though DSPs remain the dominant buying channel, private marketplaces were the runner-up method.  Read more via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0TqaWPT0A00> . 

Sales Architects 

"I think I’ve nailed what great sellers do: they engineer experiences," writes Doug Weaver in The Drift. "The mediocre ones? They’re the ones who get all caught up in the performance they’re giving, the lines they recite, and the slides they flip through." Sales pit <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00a0Uq0WUDP0L0A00> ches could benefit from less scripting and more architecting, according to Weaver.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Rakuten’s New US Commerce Data 

Rakuten confirmed its purchase of US couponer Ebates, to the tune of $1 billion. Japan-based Rakuten gets a big US commerce play, sure, but what about the data trove? Of logged-in users no less? From the release: “Members are able to enjoy a range of services [travel, digital content, financial services] through common log-in IDs. With participation of Ebates, Rakuten Group aims to create the world’s largest product line-up ranging from niche to luxury products, and to allow consumers to enjoy points rewards and cash-back upon purchase of products over various partner sites through Ebates.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/m000042040qAaLPDBic0WA0> 

Heard, Not Seen 

Forrester analyst Jim Nail sees a problem with Spotify’s foray into video. He tells Digiday's Eric Blattberg, “Quite frankly, unless [advertisers] get some kind of assurance that the majority of people will see the ad, they won’t come back back a second time," he said. But Spotify is optimistic. In an email to AdExchanger, head of global business marketing Amy Vale wrote, "Moving into video advertising was a natural progression. Our audience is genuinely engaged with both their eyes and ears and video certainly lends itself to that." Viewability fight! Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/ud0000DB4L0A0502iPqWAa0> .

TV App SDK 

A new software developer kit from ad seller (and browser maker) Opera extends its offering to connected TVs. It’s all about app monetization, according to Opera's SVP for TV and devices, Aneesh Rajaram, who claims the new solution will "support getting a bigger bang for the buck from app and device inventories." Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02e0006i00aPW04DABAqL0> .

Branding, Old School 

Writing for Ad Age, Nielsen’s VP for product leadership, Chris Louie, warns against the pitfalls of relying on programmatic for brand advertising. "The temptation is strong for brand advertisers engaging in programmatic buying to let the algorithm do the work and shift to a more periodic, reactive check of effectiveness measures," says Louie. "But this is false thinking." Insead, “Sound, independent measurement focused on core brand objectives matters in a programmatic buying environment every bit as much than in a non-programmatic one.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ai0704WB200AaPq00L0f0DA> .

MediaMath Opens Borders 

MediaMath expanded a partnership with Headway Digital that will bring more international data to its platform from Latin America and Europe. Headway Digital’s DMP DataXpand, which focuses on segmenting audiences in these markets, will be combined with MediaMath’s TerminalOne to better target campaigns in these markets, where DataXpand works with publishers to pool audience data.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Sounding Out Video 

Spotify is about to sell its first video ads, including a mobile unit that exchanges one marketer message for a half-hour of commercial free listening. More in Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0a40B4L0k2AAP00q0Da00> . Missing here is any mention of targeting in video, though we know Spotify is working on the broader segmentation opportunity. "We’ve built predictive models to determine how particular lifestyle attributes can be useful to brands," Jim Lucchese, CEO of The Echo Nest (acquired by Spotify), told AdExchanger in August <http://go.adexchanger.com/jq5B0a2LW004D0P0AAl0a00> . "By correlating all this data, we’re able to draw predictions. We can come in and give the advertising partner a lot more insights."

Data Hub 

Quaero is tossing its hat into the cross-device ring with a data-management and analytics tool aimed at digital media companies. Dubbed AdVantage, the platform integrates multiple data sources – first- and third-party data, clickstream, social, search, etc. – for a full view of the user, including all the usual metrics; think time spent, cross-device consumption and user value. Quaero President and CEO Naras Eechambadi told AdExchanger that the company has four clients signed on, “with plans to onboard several more in the near future.” More details <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00a0ma0W6DP0L0A00> .

High-Growth Africa 

Facebook now reaches 100 million in Africa (80% via mobile devices), and it’s trying to provide maximum utility there for users and advertisers. "From testing new ad units based on how people connect with each other, to enabling advertisers to customise campaigns for people depending on their device and connection speeds, we’re learning, testing and optimising." Blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4a070P00qD002LBW0nAa> .

Tuning Audio 

The IAB suggested new standards for audio ads on Monday, and opened a comment period for its so-called Digital Audio Ad Serving Template (DAAST). “Bringing consistency to the digital audio advertising space is key to its potential growth,” said Triton Digital Advertising SVP Benjamin Masse. “By requiring that all audio players support at least one DAAST-compliant format, we are helping advertisers increase demand while maintaining flexibility for player manufacturers.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP0080oL0aW00AD2q0aA04> .

Pricing Programmatic 

Speaking to Beet.TV, Forrester senior analyst Richard Joyce said agency trading desks need to rethink their pricing models, adding that traditional roles are evolving. “Agencies traditionally have always been closer to the vendors and publishers, and more knowledgeable about the advertising space," he said. He added pricing should be "more geared toward performance and marketers having transparency across different ad tech fees." Watch it <http://go.adexchanger.com/jq9B0a2LW004D0P0AAp0a00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Twitter Zags 

Whereas Google and Facebook are focused <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0axA0q0T0BAL0PD42>  on the logged-in user as the cornerstone of ad growth, Twitter may be going the opposite direction. “It’s our goal to reach the largest daily audience in the world, which means we can’t just focus on a logged-in experience which has historically been the company’s focus,” CFO Anthony Noto said in a conversation at Citi’s 2014 Global Technology Conference. SeekingAlpha transcript <http://go.adexchanger.com/ya4WDqP00A0LABU04y00020> , where there’s more on tailored timelines, email notifications and self-serve ads. The audience strategy is partly fueled by sports, music and news partnership, as VP Global Media Katie Jacobs Stanton says in a separate Re/code interview. “Ultimately the goal is to reach every person on the planet.” Read that <http://go.adexchanger.com/ya4WDqP00A0LABV04z00020> .

Killer YouTube 

YouTube has built strength upon strength, Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz declared in a research note and conference call on Google’s video money-maker. The reasons are many: strong advertising products, upfront deals with agencies (including separate $100M contracts with Publicis and IPG), and audience verification from traditional TV players. And, TrueView is a “killer” video ad format in the era of performance-driven ad metrics. Pitz writes, “The skippable format enhances the user experience while ensuring advertisers only pay up to show ads to users that opt-in (plus they get free 5 seconds of branding to boot).” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0W40La0DB0A0W0q4P20A0A> .

Programmatic MasterCard 

Late last week at a MasterCard monthly salon in NYC, media chief Ben Jankowski touched on some remaining hurdles to programmatic, among them the issue of transparency. But the biggest challenge is unpacking how agencies and platforms should manage and adapt to the programmatic ecosystem. A lot of big brands are "waiting for people to figure this out," he said. “People spend way less time with it than they should." Programmatic: everywhere you want to be. MediaPost has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PBBXD000qA2404L0a> .

Gif Ad Tech 

EA Sports is using a Google-designed ad tool to promote its Madden football game with custom gifs based on real NFL game play. "We're piloting ad delivery technology that allows brands like EA Sports to be part of [the] moment and after something happens on the field that brand can be out there on message with an ad," Mike Glaser, marketing manager of creative projects at Google, told Adweek. It remains to be seen if baiting one-liners can build social media audience. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/gY0D40L0q20aBA0AW000C4P> .

Brewers Without Borders 

Anheuser-Busch InBev, the 22nd-largest ad spender in the US, is officially outsourcing its media buying, Ad Age reported on Friday. "After this thorough process, we concluded to partner with a media agency to lead our connection strategy, media planning and buying," VP-marketing Jorn Socquet said in a statement. "This decision will guarantee that Anheuser-Busch will stay at the head of industry with innovative and breakthrough connection planning in a vastly changing media landscape."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Marketer Mistrust

Marketers are still concerned about a lack of trading desk transparency – so worried, in fact, that investment in agency trading desks declined 15% YoY, according to a WFA report that surfaced Thursday <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq089A00DWD0AP00040> . The hesitancy could explain why companies like Rocket Fuel are building programmatic products for marketers to license, wrote WSJ’s Jack Marshall <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PEB00000AW4Dq029W90> . According to those surveyed, 9.5% of online media budgets are spent programmatically today.

Social Consolidation

Business-oriented social management platform Hootsuite snapped up BrightKit, a tool used by marketers such as Kentucky Derby and Dwell to customize their social marketing campaigns. Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/ua0000DB4L0A0F02WPqWA90>  The deal follows Mixpo’s acquisition of another social ads player, Facebook PMD ShopIgnite. AdExchanger story. <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0900WqGb>  Is social ad tech ripe for a shakeout?

YouTube Converts

YouTube is often perceived as an ocean of eyeballs – most suitable for upper-funnel goals. But among social media, it also happens to be a top driver of clicks and conversions, says a study via AOL Platforms, which analyzed data from 550 million clicks and 15 million conversions in 2014's first quarter. “YouTube’s own search volume and preferential positioning on Google’s results help drive large amounts of traffic, of course. But when you get to YouTube, the content is rich, descriptive and usually helpful,” Convertro CEO Jeff Zwelling told VentureBeat. Facebook took a close second, followed by Google+ (really?). More <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLWWc0AP9H020qD40> .

Attributable IPG

Interpublic is expanding its mobile attribution capabilities through an investment in, and partnership with, Placed. "Mobile spend is the fastest-growing media category," said IPG Media Lab managing partner Chad Stoller. "Placed allows our network to easily and confidently measure attribution and provides marketers with valuable, actionable data to help shape mobile spend." Terms weren’t disclosed, but IPG CEO Michael Roth called the partnership an example of IPG "delivering the full promise of attribution and automation to our clients."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

BitTorrent Media

File-sharing giant BitTorrent is courting advertisers, but it’s a tough sell given the company’s reputation as a piracy hotbed, Digiday reported. "It is going to be a tough road for BitTorrent to convince marketers that it is a legitimate platform to do business with,” Red Peak Branding CEO James Fox said. Sites like BitTorrent have historically offloaded media through exchange environments, but that may be getting harder. Fox added that BitTorrent could attract niche advertisers by going rogue and embracing its counterculture position (think Vice). Black hat targeting?

Baidu’s Location Triggers

Baidu launched a location-based advertising service on Wednesday, dubbed Baidu Connect, that allows retailers to advertise on nearby mobile devices. The release follows the company’s push into O2O services, through a partnership with Dalian Wanda Group and Tencent. During the launch, Baidu also unveiled a $10 million investment in IndoorAtlas, a company that specializes in tracking smartphones indoors. Reuters has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBF000AF90A200WL4qPr00> .

Big Time B2B

Despite early reticence, LinkedIn’s ad engine is finding its groove. Starwood Hotels & Resorts will spend $30 million on a social campaign focused on the social business platform, as part of an effort to rally the B2B market around its Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) loyalty program. SPG SVP of Global and Digital Chris Holdren said, “The majority of b-to-b creative shows photos of empty boardrooms or generic people. Instead, Starwood enlisted its sales team to pick top business customers to be the faces of the campaign across different categories." Adweek has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/iGFW00B9PsL00A000Dq2A04> .

Raising The Targeting Bar

Campaign accuracy is down – but it’s not how it looks. Nielsen’s Online Campaign Ratings data found that only 59% of online ad impressions served across consumer segments reached their intended audience, down 10% from last year. The researcher posits that advertisers are defining segments more narrowly, thus raising the bar. “As the industry changes, so does the definition of success,” said Randall Beard, Nielsen’s global head of ad solutions. More on that <http://go.adexchanger.com/I090tWD0L4PH0A2q0F0BA00> .

Google’s Calculations

Google is pushing deeper into artificial intelligence and super-fast data processing with a new hardware research initiative focused on processors.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Media = Infrastructure

In a think piece on Amazon’s Twitch acquisition, NYT media columnist David Carr writes, “Gaming is a bandwidth hog, and Twitch is able to host multiplayer games, large events and commentary because the company invested in at least 15 data centers jammed with servers.” Amazon may hope to dominate in video and games, and their related ad opportunities, the way it did in commerce. By beating everyone else on infrastructure. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000w2Z90L0B04A4PDAq> . 

Programmatic Video And The TV Buyer

TV buyers could have a hand in how programmatic video develops, eMarketer claims in a report. "Programmatic video won’t develop exactly in the manner of the broader programmatic display space. The first efforts to create programmatic video platforms tended to parallel similar efforts for display, but TV buyers will have an important voice in the development of next-level platforms." But will buyers have a say in how cross-platform video exchanges unfold? Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLP904B00W000qAx0020A6D> .

Ad Tech M&A

Aggregate deal value in the tech, media, commerce and communications industries rose 220% in August 2014, compared with the same month a year ago, says Petsky Prunier in its latest M&A report. As for ad tech, “Analytics & Targeting and Mobile Technology were the most active Marketing Technology subsegments with each eight transactions announced, worth a combined total of $87 million in aggregate reported value. While CRM was the highest reported value subsegment with seven deals, worth $198 million.” Charts <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0900xq71> .

Weather Reorg

As part of a sales restructuring at The Weather Company, Vikram Somaya, GM of the company’s WeatherFX data/reach extension unit, will pick up oversight of all technology and ad products. “Somaya will be charged with building a suite of location-based triggers to WeatherFX, as he has done with weather-based triggers,” writes AdAge. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/m000082040qA9LPDBx20WA0>  Further proof location is ascendant in the mobile ad buy.

Algo Bazaar

A startup called Algorithmia aims to play matchmaker between underused algorithms developed by academics and businesses, MIT Technology Review reported Tuesday <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00903x0W9DP0L0A00> . With algorithms playing a larger role in media buys, could there be an application for advertisers and their agents? As Aaron Kechley, DataXu’s SVP of products, told AdExchanger last year <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000x2490L0B0aA4PDAq> , "There are no one-size-fits-all algorithms in marketing – different designs have different strengths and weaknesses.  Rather than chasing ‘the best’ algorithm, you’ll have more luck with a system that can provide flexibility and choice of algorithms designed for a wide range of marketing needs."

Training For Automation 

Writing on Medium, Martini Media CRO John Ruvolo ponders the future of sales training in an automated world. “Who is going to be having the adult conversations with marketers? Will it be a once-young 40-year-old seller who hasn’t been given useful training and finds that entertainment and free jeans aren’t as persuasive as they used to be? Or will the machines have eliminated that poor soul years before?” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/o026000cx009PW04DABAqL0>

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Buying For Display

IPONWEB gobbled up Adternity, a company specializing in workflow implementation and ad-serving solutions. The vision, according to IPONWEB CEO Boris Mouzykantskii, is to integrate IPONWEB's media-trading technology with Adternity's front-end capabilities and deepen the company's presence in the German marketplace and abroad. Are Boris and Co., known for building and selling ad tech to others such as Yahoo’s Right Media, starting to get more proprietary? Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000P9z00q2A0q> .

Havas Algorithm

Havas reported earnings on Friday, boasting an organic growth rate of 5.7%. In response to the potential threat of disintermediation in programmatic buying, Havas CEO Yannick Bolloré told investors, "More and more ... we are buying programmatically. At Havas we have developed our algorithm and we have a special organization that avoids robots to see ads. It's a very pure programmatic buying.” Bolloré added, “When we compare our programmatic tools with others, we are ahead of the competition."

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP9C0qq0AD00B4B020W0> Platform Called Wanda

Beijing-based retail and real estate conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group teamed with China's Tencent and Baidu for its foray into ecommerce. The yet unnamed platform (simply called Wanda ecommerce for now) will focus on offline-to-online sales, as it competes with e-retail giant Alibaba. In a statement, Tencent commented, "The three partners will further deepen collaboration on initiatives such as traffic sharing, media and advertising resources sharing, membership benefits, payment and internet finance [and] big data."

Native Scale

A survey of UK media agencies by Adyoulike found that native ads take 15% of display budgets, but standardization issues loom. "Agencies are particularly interested in the issues of scaling native advertising, effective regulation and overcoming some of the perceived issues around content creation," said Adyoulike Managing Director Francis Turner, as reported by The Drum.
