 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Yahoo, The Hunted? 

After spinning off its $39 billion stake in Alibaba, Yahoo can focus on its Internet business. And it may be more approachable to strategic buyers. Once the spinoff is complete, Yahoo’s estimated market value will be less than $10 billion, “a more digestible amount for a private equity firm or another Internet company,” writes New York Times reporter Michael de la Merced <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tu0WR0P0h000DBW20L4qAA0> . But in the meantime, analysts doubt Yahoo will plan any major acquisitions. “Despite speculation to the contrary, we don’t consider larger acquisitions — Flurry, BrightRoll or Tumblr-sized or larger — unless they really align with mobile, video, native or social,” Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer told analysts. 

Sizing Native 

Two-thirds of marketers will increase their native advertising spend this year, according to data from the Association of National Advertisers. But of the 127 marketers surveyed by the ANA, 68% said native advertising is 5% or less of their ad budgets. "The main benefit of native advertising is the ability to create extremely relevant associations between the brand and consumer via content," reads the ANA study <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00RA0L0DX00hB2qW0AvP04> . "Given today's media landscape, where consumers can avoid ads more than ever, advertisers are looking for new ways to get their messages noticed and acted upon." Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/FhDBL00Yw0W0P2Rq000AA04> . 

Digital Media Ascends 

Re/code’s Peter Kafka reports Business Insider’s valuation may have doubled in its latest round, to approximately $200 million. Sources tell Kafka <http://go.adexchanger.com/qhAW0A0DLx004R02B0PZ00q>  BI likely generated $30 million in revenue last year, a notable jump from 2013’s $18 million. Across the board, investors are throwing money at publishers like Vice, BuzzFeed, Vox Media and Mashable, and Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget says there’s a reason. “There’s no question in my mind that everything is going digital. And there’s no question in my mind that a bunch of companies have figured out a model that works.” 

White House Tackles Data Collection 

The White House is picking up the pace on a planned online privacy bill, with the proposed measure expected to surface next month. At its core, the bill would limit the ability of companies like Google and Facebook to access consumer data while also bestowing upon the Federal Trade Commission more regulatory clout. If passed, online advertisers, mobile app developers and other Internet players would have to obtain consumers’ expressed permission before collecting or sharing data, and firms would face government fines for failing to adhere to the proposed measures.

EA’s In-Game Ads 

Electronic Arts has a new in-game ad product, called EA Engagement Ads. The format incentivizes gamers to engage with rewards, and brands like GMC, McDonald’s, Ford, Kellogg’s and Paramount are onboard. The real kicker is what the ad format could mean for gathering engagement data via mobile devices. “We can help players advance in games courtesy of brands,” EA’s SVP of global media solutions, Dave Madden, told The Wall Street Journal. “That’s much easier to scale in mobile.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00S10ALAWPAhB02q000> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Agencies On Board With Armstrong 

Though Google hasn’t been keen on making music with agencies, AOL seems to be hitting the right notes. As AOL repositions as an ad tech and media company, a handful of agency execs tell Digiday they’re swayed by the company’s offerings. Those include a programmatic ad platform as well as a slate of original video content featuring talent like Steve Buscemi and James Franco. But questions remain. “Will they start prioritizing their own publishers and content in a way that both increases costs and decreases transparency for buyers and advertisers?” asks Josh Engroff, Media Kitchen’s chief digital media officer. Read the full story <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0hnA0000q0DT20LAWN> . Meanwhile, AOL’s Dan Ackerman, programmatic SVP of Adapt.tv, tells Beet.TV that TV ads could be 10% programmatic by 2017. Watch the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00NA0L0DU00hB2qW0AoP04> . 

Game-Time Decisions 

Facebook’s adopting a Twitter-like ad strategy this Super Bowl Sunday by selling ads that target people based on the posts they make in real time. Twitter, for its part, is staffing “war rooms” for its Super Bowl advertisers. These “unplanned” ad strategies are growing this year, according to Twitter’s director of US brand strategy, Ross Hoffman. "There is a lot more fragmentation," said Dionne Colvin-Lovely, director of traditional and emerging media at Toyota. "TV is an important media; it's not as dominant. We need to make sure we have a strong presence online and in mobile. It's more complicated now." Reuters has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqpP04A0LB0WAN02h0000VD> . 

Hulu’s View 

Remember how some publishers weren’t thrilled about the industry’s fixation on viewability? Well, Hulu is just fine with it – the video site has profited from building in viewability parameters, Hulu SVP of ad sales Peter Naylor tells The Wall Street Journal. <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqqP04A0LB0WAN02h0000WD>  Of course, Hulu’s business model is a bit unique. Its videos don’t autoplay and it sells 30-second ads, so it doesn’t have a problem meeting advertisers’ viewability requirements. (For the record, the MRC’s baseline recommendation is 50% in view for two consecutive seconds.) But Naylor is empathetic. “It’s an incredibly challenging time to be a publisher,” he said. “Over the last few years, we’ve seen agencies deal with this push from ad agency procurement departments. It’s become the golden age of accountability. Now you’ve got all this complexity, and viewability is just another thing on the list.” 

Waterfall Debate 

Responding to Beeswax CEO Ari Paparo’s AdExchanger column <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0XNhWPr0A00>  questioning the existence of publisher waterfalls in the efficient world of RTB, Datacratic software engineer Nicolas Kruchten demystifies the practice. Publisher waterfalls happen because of RTB’s second-price auction, in which the top bidder only pays the amount of the second-highest bid. Publishers end up feeling they’ve left money on the floor. With a waterfall, publishers have more control. They can slowly lower the floor price if impressions aren’t selling. Kruchten is cool with this in theory: The top bidder gets the impression for the price she wants and the publisher gets a little more money. “On more practical grounds, however, it’s clear that running multiple auctions for the same impression is inefficient, and has non-zero costs which could well outweigh any benefits,” he concludes. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/yhNWDqP00A0LABY04s00020> . 

Thinknear And Mopub Partner 

Thinknear added native mobile ad formats on Thursday through a partnership with Mopub. Thinknear specializes in location-based mobile advertising and works with clients like BlackBerry, 1-800-Flowers, Walmart, UPS, KIA, McDonalds and Southwest Airlines. "Native advertising is increasingly more important to the digital ad ecosystem, as native ads see much greater engagement," said Thinknear President Loren Hillberg. "This partnership enables us to connect an emerging ad format with the proven benefits of location targeting that we have been consistently delivering to our clients for years."

Kik Dreams Big 

Mobile messaging firm Kik aspires to be the “WeChat of the West,” according to CEO Ted Livingston. It’s made strides towards that goal by hitting 200 million registered users on Wednesday. “When I read pieces about David Marcus [head of messaging products at Facebook], or I see what Snapchat is launching, everybody is moving toward this ‘chat as a platform,’” Livingston told Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000O22h0L0B0xA4PDAq> . “We’ve been doing this longer than anybody and it’s now a race to get to the finish before anybody else. And we’re racing some of the top companies in the world.” Read AdExchanger’s Kik coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/FhDBL003y0W0P2Oq000AA04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Viewability Battleground 

The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Shields takes a deep dive on viewability and finds rancor. Publishers are upset about lost revenue, vendors want new methods of bidding with viewability metrics and advertisers are demanding make-goods on their investments. “The industry needs to aspire to 100% viewability,” said Google’s VP of display ad products, Neal Mohan. “The only way you can truly achieve that for publishers is baking that technology natively into the ad server as opposed to an after-the-fact report.” Mohan’s counterpart at AOL, David Miller, disagrees: “While most ads can be measured as viewable or not, there are hundreds of millions of viewable ads which are not being measured as viewable because the technology to detect and tally all types of ads is not there yet.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/FhDBL001s0W0P2Kq000AA04> . 

Into The Feed 

Pinterest has extended its core paid media product, Promoted Pins, to the platform’s engagement-rich “home feed.” This will push ads closer to users, as in Facebook and Twitter’s news feeds. But why is Pinterest pushing its ad product now? “I would say we are speeding things up because the advertisers are ready,” Joanne Bradford, Pinterest’s head of partnerships, told The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB002WqA000hPKA0t040D2L> . “We’ve worked very hard over the course of the beta period and took all those learnings and built a very aggressive road map for 2015.” Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00D3A02000BWK0q4huLP0A> . A spokesperson tells AdExchanger, “Since there is an additional quality bar we will show less ads in the home feed then we will in category and search feeds.” 

Beacon Breakthrough 

In-store beacons aren’t novel and neither is online retargeting, but combining the strategies could be a breakthrough for adland. Location-based marketing firm Total Communicator Solutions and ad server Unacast are partnering to let advertisers use in-store beacon data for display retargeting campaigns. “Until now, the utility of beacons has been limited to allowing retailers and brands to communicate with shoppers whilst they are in the store,” writes Business Insider advertising editor Lara O'Reilly. “Now beacons are acting as the data collector to inform post-shopping ad campaigns.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/DW4400v0ABD00K0hL02P0Aq> . 

PubMatic’s APIs 

PubMatic will let its publisher customers plug their supply into Bidtellect’s native ad exchange, the companies said Tuesday. Buyers can snatch up native ad inventory programmatically through Bidtellect’s native DSP, while publishers can package their native slots into private marketplaces or expose it to indirect demand. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P540K0DwAhq2> . The move continues a wave of partnership and API news from PubMatic, which still positions as a “pure-play” SSP. More on that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/GhB0AK20Dx46W0AL0000P0q>

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Snapchat: Where’s The Data 

Snapchat is still a product in search of a revenue model, Digitas LBi UK CEO Scott Ross told The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0hS0B4L0x2AAP00q0DE00> . “It’s very, very difficult for advertisers and marketers to get the metrics they need to validate their campaigns and media spend.” Meanwhile, the NYT reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LEy2TADP0h00A0>  on the growth of Snapchat and other messaging apps. 

Video Fraud: YouTube’s Not Immune 

A new type of malware dubbed Trojan.Tubrosa is responsible for more than 2 million fraudulent YouTube video views, monetized with ads through the platform’s partner program. “In order to keep its malicious activities secret, the malware will lower the volume of the compromised computer’s speakers to zero,” Symantec researchers explained in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqUB0h2LW004D0P0AAz0E00> . “The malware will even update or install Flash on the user’s computer to allow it to view these videos.” Gigaom has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0EA0DB0WA2Lq00hA00V4P0> . 

Tumblr Could Lose Autonomy 

Yahoo may merge Tumblr’s sales force into its own, according to reports in Valleywag <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00h0BE0WWDP0L0A00>  and Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/uC0000DB4L0A0X02EPqWAh0> . If true, it would suggest less autonomy for Tumblr, which Yahoo insisted would remain independent when it acquired the social blogging site for $1.1 billion in 2013. “One thing that is clear is that Mayer has touted, and will continue to tout, the impact of Tumblr on mobile and native growth across Yahoo,” writes Re/code co-executive editor Kara Swisher, “even if the standalone business has not been as lucrative as promised.” 

The A List 

Several programmatic ad companies made the cut of Forbes’ most recent list <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000Y2040qAhLPDBED0WA0>  of the 100 most promising companies in the US, MediaPost reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PZB00000AE4Dq02hWE0> . The Trade Desk, Accordant Media, Integral Ad Science, Tapad and LiveIntent made the cut. “Revenue growth plays a big part in choosing the ranking for America’s Most Pro,” Forbes said of its methodology.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

AOL Reorgs For A Programmatic Future 

AOL is close to a big restructuring that will impact sales teams serving the company’s sprawling media brands and ad platforms. Re/code reports the changes “will mean the collapsing of several sales teams into one, moving specialized ad people (servicing flagship content properties like the Huffington Post and TechCrunch) into a central organization led by Bob Lord.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0K102q0L0AB0Dh00AA4> . Speaking at AdExchanger’s Industry Preview conference last week, CEO Tim Armstrong confirmed changes are coming. He added, “We will get ahead of the trends, and that’s video content and mobile content, and you’ll see us get ahead in the ad tech stack by looking at the Internet of Things and how that can add to the stack.” 

Marissa Mayer On Personalization 

Speaking at an “In data we trust” panel late last week, Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer touched on PII and data collection. The company, she confirmed, has tweaked its data storage and sharing protocols in the wake of last year’s NSA spying revelations, but Mayer made a direct case for applying tracking insights on the web. “A personalised internet is a better internet,” Mayer said. “To get here we need to have transparency and afford the individual control [and] make a statement that users own their data, which they can examine, take it with them to other sites and vendors that they trust more in a market that helps people make these trade-offs and decisions.” The problem, she added, is that some “vendors are not being transparent enough and not providing enough controls and choice." Read on at The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00LWqA000hPAA02040D2L> . 

Less RTB For WPP 

Speaking to Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0P3B00000AA4Dq02hWM0> , David Moore, WPP Digital president and Xaxis chairman, said the company is steering its business away from RTB and deeper into direct deals. “Private marketplaces are going to be where we do most of our business in 2015,” Moore said. “It gives us the opportunity to do direct deals with publishers, allow them to sell us ads at a price that is good for both of us.” WPP will limit its use of RTB inventory, citing complications around viewability and ad fraud as two factors driving the decision. 

Tumbling Into Creative 

Tumblr, the social blogging site owned by Yahoo, wants to leverage the creativity of its users to to sell more ads. Late last week, the company debuted what it’s calling the Creatrs Network, which head of creative strategy David Hayes described as Tumblr’s first “formal structure” for connecting brands and advertisers to its users. Through the network, brands can tap Tumblr for sponsored content, and Tumblr will pay its users to generate GIF, photo or video content for ads. That content can run either on Tumblr, or across any of Yahoo’s online properties. “We think we have the largest creative class on the entire Internet,” said Hayes. “With Creatrs, we can drive traffic from our community both to the artist and the brand at the same time.” Earned media FTW!

Travel Marketer Merger 

After partnering for two years, Expedia will buy Travelocity for $280 million. “The deal underscores how crowded the online-travel industry has become,” writes WSJ reporter Chelsey Dulaney <http://go.adexchanger.com/yhAWDqP00A0LABO04500020> , with traditional travel sites like Expedia, Priceline.com and Orbitz facing competition from emerging players like Kayak, Google, and AirBnB. Travelocity’s ad budgets, and its data too, will be subsumed into Expedia’s marketing machine.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Pinterest's Year Of Intent 

“The focus this year is on unlocking the potential of our intent data," Pinterest operations head Don Faul told an audience at AdExchanger's Industry Preview conference. Pinterest recently rolled out its Promoted Pins product to all US advertisers, but targeting remains limited to demographic and device data. The real gold mine lies in lower-funnel targeting of the home renovator or compulsive traveler. Look for incremental targeting enhancements over the course of 2015. More in The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PfB2D000qA2w04L0h> .

Snapchat O&O 

Snapchat wants to host content, according to Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0hhA0000q0D420LAWw> . A forthcoming feature dubbed Discover will funnel videos, texts and photos from major media companies like ESPN, CNN and Vice straight to Snapchat users. “Snapchat is on to something that will be incredibly meaningful for its audience and super helpful for reaching people who aren’t consuming content on TV, newspapers and magazines,” comments KC Estenson, former head of digital at CNN. Power to the publisher. 

Mobile Piggybank 

Mobile ad vet Nihal Mehta left the ad tech world in 2013 to focus on his investment firm, Eniac Ventures. On Wednesday, the firm raised $55 million that it will funnel into a pool of 25 mobile startups. According to Ad Age, Eniac Ventures is particularly interested in connected devices, app development, personal utility, messaging, enterprise and commerce. "The next big wave of mobile ad tech companies will be bigger than we've ever seen because they're going to be forced to deal with a supply of new inventory. It doesn't live anymore in banner ads. It lives in messaging, communications, interstitials, natively,” said Mehta. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLwW50APhi020qD40> .

AOL Chief On Cross-Device IDs 

Responding to the cross-device ID trend and how it relates to the future of ad targeting, AOL chief Tim Armstrong pegged AOL as an early investor in the space. “We have 100 million-plus IDs with cross-device targeting right now,” Armstrong said during a fireside chat at AdExchanger’s Industry Preview in NYC. But, he added, “People-based targeting, or what we do with cross-device linking, is the first generation of commoditized targeting. I think we’re looking at a 20-year cycle to getting to non-commoditized targeting. All of the targeting stuff going on right now is really interesting, and it will work in a much larger network world, but my guess is that almost everyone’s spending their time on similar types of targeting that will get commoditized.” So the question is: What’s the next level of targeting?

With Kosei, Pinterest could build out its ad offerings by using Kosei’s tech to generate “object graphs,” or a digital map of products specific pinners are likely to buy. “It’s a relatively blatant advertising push for the company, which just expanded Promoted Pins to all US advertisers for the first time earlier this month,” writes Re/code’s Kurt Wagner. “Pinterest has billions of Pins on the platform, so if the company can identify which products users most want to see, they should be able to create a better ad experience.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0EshWPN0A00> . 

Facebook’s Super Bowl Play 

Facebook’s game-day plan of attack is to lure ad dollars from linear TV. To do that, Facebook began scanning users’ likes, comments and statuses for key words related to the Super Bowl, and selling those audience segments to advertisers. Last year, Facebook trialed a similar offering, but targeting was limited to general fans of football with no real-time capabilities to speak of. "There are a lot of people who want to be involved with the Super Bowl and not pay Super Bowl ad rates," said Horizon Media SVP-Research Brad Adgate. "I think it's part of their strategy to siphon off as many dollars from television as possible. There's probably close to $400 million spent by marketers on the Super Bowl.

Choozle Raises $4.1 Million 

Digital ad platform Choozle raised $4.1 million in funding, following a $1.8 million seed round last March. About 100 digital marketers use the platform, which combines DMP and DSP capabilities for marketers like Cricket Wireless and Gaiam Yoga. But it’s less complex for the end user: “Our ideal customer is an independent agency that…is ready to take on the power of programmatic. The platform is powerful, but doesn’t require a data scientist and/or seasoned media trader for its operation,” founder and CEO Andrew Fischer told AdExchanger. Using the interface, it could figure out what its customers have in common (a college degree and a recent apparel purchase, for example) and then use that targeting to execute a buy on Facebook through Choozle, Fischer explained.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

War On Big Tech  

The EU’s crusade against US tech firms rages on, according to the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Phg00q2a0p> , and in 2015 could stymie Google, Facebook and others from releasing products and holding on to EU web data. Among the investigations being waged by the European Commission is an antitrust study of Google, as well as tax investigations into Amazon and Apple’s fillings. The fervor against US tech firms is fueled by economic competition, said UK competition regulator Alex Chisholm. “The digital giants are blowing a Schumpeterian gale through our economies,” he said last month. Added Jan Philipp Albrecht, a European lawmaker representing Germany’s Green party, “We want to open up opportunities for new competitors to be [in the EU].”  

Bravo Eyes Native  

Bravo and Oxygen Media’s digital chief, Lisa Hsia, tells Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PhB00000Ap4Dq02hWb0>  that Bravo’s business is changing rapidly. Mobile video growth is in the triple digits, and the company is eyeing commerce opportunities. “The holy grail that I’d like to achieve is to build some sort of transactional business on top of the basic advertising and distribution business of Bravo and Oxygen, and I think the second screen will be critical to making that happen.” Hsia added that in 2015 one of Bravo’s main goals is to push into native advertising. “Native advertising is something that we’re very interested in doing and, for us, we’re just beginning down that road,” she said. 

HealthCare.gov Tag-sploitation? 

HealthCare.gov is collecting data on users that visit the site, and potentially sharing that infromation with third parties, AP reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pc40p0DiAhq2> . The site affirms that no PII is shared externally, but third-party sites embedded on HealthCare.gov may be able to correlate a visit to the site with other Internet activities and build a consumer profile based on that data. Catchpoint Systems CEO Mehdi Daoud was surprised to see third parties like Google’s data-analytics service, Twitter, Facebook and other online ad vendors present on HealthCare.gov. "Personally, I look at this, and I am on a government website, and I don't know what is going on between the government and Facebook, and Google, and Twitter. Why is that there?” Daoudi said. 

Metrics Money 

Show me the mobile ROI! Brands are looking for better measurement before they shell out more on mobile – and AppsFlyer wants to capitalize on that. The Israeli company plans to use the bulk of a Fidelity-led $15 million Series B round to develop new measurement tools. The rest will go toward international expansion, including offices in San Francisco and Beijing. Total funding for AppsFlyer, which also provides deep-linking services [AdExchanger analysis <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lpd2jADP0h00A0> ] now stands at $27.1 million. “In the last two years, advertisers shifted more and more test budgets to mobile,” AppsFlyer CEO Oren Kaniel told AdExchanger. “We expect to see massive mobile ad spend growth in the very near future.” Read more in TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/GhB0Ap20Dk4eW0AL0000P0q> .  

Digital Ad Spend Accelerates 

New data from Strategy Analytics suggests that digital advertising is creeping closer to one-third of 2015’s projected total ad spend, or $52.8 billion of a whopping $187 billion. That puts digital about $30 billion behind TV ads, and makes it the fastest-growing category (at a rate of 13%). “Despite digital’s best efforts, the drop in traditional ad revenues means we’ll see fairly modest growth in overall U.S. ad revenues in 2015 and will have to wait for more significant growth in 2016, courtesy of the U.S. presidential elections and summer Olympics,” writes Strategy Analytics analyst Michael Goodman.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google Ad Tech: All Or Nothing? 

Remember that big to-do <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00ke0ALAWPfhB02q000>  in which Google wanted to muzzle pixel-firing for DMP-DSP hybrids by Jan. 1? Well, that deadline has been pushed to end of March, which should please the vendors who felt January was a bit soon. But the bigger point, according to Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PgBfD000qA2k04L0h> , is that this move further underscores the way in Google is trying to strong-arm advertisers to buy using the Google tech stack. Digiday also ran a story earlier this month about Google pushing YouTube inventory at CPG giant Mondel?z, at TubeMogul’s expense <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00gWqA000hPkA0h040D2L> . If these reports are accurate, it seems Google will have its way only if advertisers let it. Digiday reports Kellogg doesn’t buy from YouTube “because it does not allow third parties to measure the effectiveness of ads there." AdExchanger sources, however, claimed some powerhouse advertisers have forced Google into using third-party measurements on YouTube. 

AOL Cleans House 

Sources tell TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0iL0000kP02BAqDh0h40A>  that its parent company is planning a reorg that will take the form of layoffs and website closures. The impending cuts will further focus its business on ad tech, content operations and video. AOL-owned TechCrunch is not privy to corporate-level decisions, but sources say the restructuring will unfold in the coming weeks. During the company’s Q3 2014 earnings call, CEO Tim Armstrong hinted that AOL would look for “an increase in the value and growth of our global content brands by simplifying the portfolio of brands and increasing our share of video and mobile in key content areas.” 

Platisher Paradox 

As new media companies struggle for scale and traditional media companies strive to stay abreast of digitial, the divide between publisher and platform continues to blur. “Making these hybrids work over the long term is difficult, because their incentives work against each other,” writes independent journalist Lydia Laurenson for Harvard Business Review. As proof, Laurenson points to Say Media, which sold off its publishing properties last year and repositioned as a tech platform. “The conclusion we’ve come to, and one lots of media companies wrestle with is, do you build brands or do you build platforms,” wrote Say Media CEO Matt Sanchez at the time. “Those two are just completely different world views.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00kA0L0Di00hB2qW0AjP04> . 

Short Form Rising 

ABI Research reports that OTT content from subscription services like Netflix and Hulu continues to generate the most revenue for advertisers, but short-form content is heating up. According to the findings, overall online video will rack up an estimated $56 billion by 2019 and short-form content could grow in kind, to a projected $13 billion. “Multi-channel networks that work with content contributors and advertising agencies targeting services like YouTube are finding suitors and partners among some of the largest industry players in video,” said Practice Director Sam Rosen. Advanced Television has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/qhAW0A0DLk004k02B0Pj00q> . 

APAC Booming 

Ad tech firm Adknowledge is partnering with Axiata Digital Advertising to expand its presence in APAC’s $47 billion digital ad market. Axiata Digital Advertising is a subsidiary of telecom firm Axiata, and the partnership is mobile-first. “The immediate target markets are Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and India,” explained Adknowledge CEO Ben Legg, but India will follow. “India is already number two in terms of digital advertising after Indonesia and given the growing penetration of smartphones, this market is set to expand further.” Read on via The Economic Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ak0l04WB200AhPq00L0k0DA> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Turn Drops ‘Respawned’ Cookies 

Turn will quit using Verizon’s unique ID header (aka “zombie cookie”) in the wake of some bad  <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lgd2aADP0h00A0> press. "We have heard the concerns and are actively re-evaluating this method,” Turn chief privacy officer Max Ochoa writes in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PbB00000Ag4Dq02hWe0> . “In the meantime, we have begun work to suspend the re-association of a Turn cookie ID with a Verizon UIDH.” Starting next month, Turn says, the company won’t “respawn” cookie IDs tied to the persistent device header. It also hints at inaccuracies in articles published by ProPublica’s Julia Angwin (of WSJ’s “What They Know” series fame) and a blog post written by Jonathan Mayer, a Stanford professor and privacy advocate. Read more. <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PbB00000Ag4Dq02hWe0>  

Scaling Atlas 

Facebook is aggressively staffing up in Atlas, its ad-server-and-then-some product, with more than 20 positions posted, reports WTAQ News <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPhf0gq0AD00B4c020W0> . A closer look at Facebook’s job site turns up openings for optimization specialists, client partners, measurement specialists and product marketing managers. Two jobs are of particular note. One is a head of sales ops <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000g2gh0L0B0dA4PDAq>  responsible for establishing a “rhythm of the business” around publisher ad tech and advertiser ad tech.  Another will run holding company sales <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00Lgh2eADP0h00A0> . Your move, Google. 

The Programmatic Super Bowl 

The Super Bowl is almost upon us and, according to industry execs, ads will be more personalized. "Where it's going to get interesting this year is the sort of interplay between programmatic and human-based [communication]," Brand Networks CEO Jamie Tedford told NBC News. Referring to “opportunistic social media,” Tedford said advertisers are working hard to link social platforms to commercials in real time. "How much of that can we make programmatic, can we tee up in advance [like] syncing tweets or posts with ad," he pondered. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0ig0Lh0DB0f0W0q4P20A0A> . 

Reddit’s Mobile Data 

An update to Reddit’s privacy policy and user agreement clarifies its use of audience data and introduces an opt-out for data collection. “We believe most of our mobile users are more willing to share information to have better experiences,” said Reddit CEO Ellen Pao in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00g0jL0gW00AD2q0hA04> . “We are experimenting with some ad partners to see if we can provide better advertising experiences in our mobile apps.” VentureBeat has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0gWD0Lh000B4000hk> . 

Escalating Native 

The New York Times is advertising at least seven jobs in its in-house native content division, Capital New York reports. The so-called T Brand Studio has been churning out branded content – last year it conceived more than 40 campaigns for the likes of Netflix and Shell. And paid posts generated a 16.5% increase in revenue during Q3 2014. Will 2015 bring the first data-driven content campaign? More <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PiDgA40LhB00lA> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

NBCU Surfaces More Audience Data 

“Advertisers don't need to choose between data-driven targeting, which lives mostly in digital, and the scale of TV," Linda Yaccarino, ad sales honcho at NBC Universal, told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPhg0cq0AD00B49020W0> . To back that, NBC Universal’s calling attention to its Audience Targeting Platform, debuted during last year’s upfront. This year, the broadcast behemoth plans to pitch inventory more like digital, leveraging set-top box data and other insights to more narrowly slice its audiences. Adds Yaccarino, “Clients want more precision, effectiveness and efficiencies.” Targeting is still contextual. Advertisers will buy shows, not individual impressions, but have more audience attributes to inform the decision. 

Ad Products Shuffle At Yahoo 

After shuttering the exchange formerly known as Right Media (AdExchanger story <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DhA02000BWc0q4haLP0A> ), Marissa Mayer is making org changes in the company’s ad platforms. Flurry product chief Prashant Fuloria will oversee all ad products, WSJ reports from on an internal memo. Reporting to him will be current ad tech honcho Scott Burke, who is praised in the memo, and Brightroll CEO Tod Sacerdoti. “We’re aligning our product teams to better execute our revenue goals,” Mayer wrote to staff. “2015 is the year that we return our display revenue to growth." Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00ci0ALAWPbhB02q000>  And, Re/code has some details <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PcB00000Ac4Dq02hWj0> . 

Slapping Verizon 

Verizon’s persistent mobile tracking mechanism, called PrecisionID, is drawing some negative attention this week. Writing in his Web Policy blog, Stanford professor and privacy gadfly Jonathan Mayer posted a teardown of Verizon’s “zombie cookie” and how one company, buy-side platform Turn, appears to be using it. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPhk0cq0AD00B4d020W0>  ProPublica’s Julia Angwin and Mike Tigas then run with the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PeDcA40LhB00lA> , stating, “ProPublica's tests showed that even Verizon users who installed the Turn opt-out cookie continued to receive the Turn tracking cookie as well. Turn said despite the appearance of the tracking cookie, it continues to honor the opt-out cookie.” Here’s more from the AdExchanger crypt: Can You Identify Me Now?

Creative Automation 

2014 was the year for programmatic (named word of the year by the ANA <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWn400g0ABD00c0hL02P0Aq> !), but 2015 will see a deeper focus on creativity within automation, according to Warc. In its Toolkit 2015 report, Warc sussed out that Kellogg thinks programmatic is 30% about the media and 70% about the creative. "To date, the debate around programmatic media has been firmly centered on the 'how' of operations and behavioral metrics such as cost per click," commented Millward Brown’s global brand director for digital, Duncan Southgate. "In 2015 we expect marketers to be equally focused on the benefits programmatic may be able to bring to building meaningful brands and the opportunities to leverage it more creatively."

WebMD Chief On Advertising 

Speaking to investors on Thursday, WebMD CEO David Schlanger said health-inclined sites are uniquely positioned to link advertisers to audiences. The blockbuster drugs of the past were targeted to large audiences, he said, but the shift to digital allows pharmaceutical companies and advertisers to isolate conditions and target those niche audiences. “For those niche audiences, it’s really inefficient to use mass media [for targeting] because you’re looking for a needle in the haystack,” he said, “Whereas on WebMD we can target those audiences effectively, and measure the impact of the program. The nature of pharma pipelines is going to help the migration from mass media to digital.”

Youths And Their Apps 

Young Americans are spending as much or more time in messaging apps as on social networks, according to a study published Thursday by Frank N. Magid Associates. The data shows that messaging apps are cannibalizing lots of 14- to 17-year-olds from Facebook. “Users have become accustomed to interacting with brands on platforms like Facebook and Twitter," said Tero Kuittinen, managing director at Magid Associates. "However, as older social apps struggle with momentum in the youth market, brands are taking a closer look at messenger platforms like Kik and Snapchat, which offer unrestricted organic reach and younger audiences that want to engage with brands." Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00rWqA000hPcA0k040D2L> . 

Put A Pin In It 

Forrester released a report on Thursday that takes a good, hard – mostly hard – look at Pinterest. According to the report, the data behind the social scrapbooking site has the potential to drive more sales than Facebook’s data, but advertisers are struggling to capitalize on it. “Pinterest’s marketing value lies more in the future than in the present,” writes Forrester analyst Nate Elliott. “By 2016, Pinterest’s ad offering could trump that of other social sites. ... Once the site broadens its targeting capabilities, though, it’ll be time to spend.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLcWs0APhl020qD40> …and still more from CMO Today and Pinfluencers <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00tWqA000hPcA0m040D2L> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

What Is Medialink? 

Many ad tech names are dropped in Re/code’s in-depth profile of Medialink, a consulting/headhunting/networking/party-planning firm that has become indispensable in digital media circles. Metamarkets, Unified Social and Sharethrough have cameos in Nellie Bowles' story, paying Medialink in order to be introduced to the right people. "Relationships have become more important with technology, not less,” says Wenda Harris Millard. "It’s people who know how to build relationships who will always win over people who think the whole world will turn into one giant algorithm." Metamarkets CEO Mike Driscoll puts it a little more concisely: "They’re like LinkedIn, but in the flesh." Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0h07WD0L4PS0A2q040BA00>  

Game Streaming Heats Up 

Dailymotion is stepping into the ring with Twitch and YouTube with a game-footage streaming site of its own, dubbed Dailymotion Games. Currently in beta, Dailymotion Games says users can create their own streams, and those feeds are monetizable through ads. “Live gaming, in particular, is exploding,” writes The Wall Street Journal’s Brian Fitzgerald. “Pro-gaming championships sell out sports arenas, while millions of others watch online and on traditional broadcasters like ESPN. Twitch, a leader in live gaming video, was courted by Google before Amazon.com swooped in and bought it in 2014 for nearly $1 billion.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/TT0W40P0h000DB820L4qAA0> . 

Video On Twitter’s Radar 

Speaking at a mobile conference in the UK on Wednesday, Twitter UK’s entertainment lead, Matt Boak, said 2015 is Twitter’s year of video. “Some of you will already be aware of our native player which contains a pre-expanded, one-click play video unit. … We’re actually going to be making that available to all advertisers this year, which is a great first step in making video the natural platform on Twitter,” said Boak.“[There is] so much more coming on video [at Twitter] and there’s going to be a slew of amazing announcements coming throughout this year and next.” Read on via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00L492UADP0h00A0> . 

AdSlot Goes Direct With PubMatic


PubMatic customers can plug into "guaranteed" demand through a partnership with AdSlot. PubMatic CMO Terri Walter told AdExchanger the partnership complements, rather than replaces, its own development of programmatic direct solutions. She cited the June hire of Evan Simeone as VP of programmatic direct, engineering. “Having a partner like AdSlot enables us to really scale on the buy side, so we can continue our focus on the publisher side,” Walter said. “We both agree interoperability is important.” Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q04A0DB0Wa2Lq00hA00V4P0> . Last month AdSlot partnered with Operative. 

All Eyes On ROI 

Customer-centricity is crucial for data-driven ads, says a report from AOL Platforms that draws on Convertro campaign data from eight industries collected over two years. “Legacy methodologies such as last-click or first-touch are not up to the specifications necessary for marketers today to fully understand how their dollars are being spent,” reads the report. “A best practice for improving ROI should include multiple buying tools, an advanced MTA methodology and an advertiser’s first-party data."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Teradata Shops 

Analytics firm Teradata will buy Israeli push-messaging company Appoxee for a cool $20-25 million, according to TechCrunch sources <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PwB00000A04Dq02hWP0> . Appoxee works with developers and publishers for app user retention by launching push notification reminders to complete an unfinished game, or retrieve an abandoned shopping cart. Through the acquisition, Appoxee will be rolled into Teradata’s Integrated Marketing Cloud services. Teradata confirmed the acquisition, though not the financial terms of the deal. Another Israeli tech firm exits. Teradata previously acquired campaign management with Aprimo and email marketing from the German company eCircle. More from the AdExchanger crypt <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0hx0B4L0Q2AAP00q0D000> . 

Legacy Plagues Programmatic TV 

“We’re in a nascent timeframe for programmatic TV,” Videology’s global head of TV strategy, Rhys  <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PyD0A40LhB00RA> McLachlan, told Beet.TV at CES in Las Vegas. “There is a huge amount of receptivity from the demand side – ad agencies have woken up to the efficiencies programmatic can bring – though we are somewhat behind the ball as it relates to the data sets, to provide efficient measurement.” McLachlan added that programmatic TV will likely take off more quickly in APAC, as the region lacks the legacy constraints that are stalling markets elsewhere. 

WebMD's Healthy Revenues 

WebMD's revenue for Q4, and for full-year 2014, could exceed previous predictions. The health information provider relies on sponsorship and ad revenues from large pharmaceutical firms and, according to a filing, WebMD management “is pleased with advertising and sponsorship sales activity for its Public Portals in the fourth quarter of 2014,” and, “expects revenue growth for its Private Portals in 2015 to be in the mid-single digits.” More via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0S0hWPz0A00> . A WebMD spokesperson declined further comment. It’s unclear what's driving performance, but a related report from Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02T000A000hPW04DABAqL0>  sees decreasing pharma ad regulations sparking a renaissance for pharma marketing. 

Chahal, Cont. 

Ex-RadiumOne chief Gurbaksh Chahal started his current company, Gravity4, some six months ago, after being fired from RadiumOne amid domestic violence allegations. Now Gravity4 has unveiled plans to snap up cloud-based CRM software firm CRM.me. "We are excited to add CRM.me to the Gravity4 Marketing OS Platform," Chahal said, "further enabling us to provide brands, agencies and publishers a gamut of solutions to reach consumers throughout their purchase journey and across all devices." The acquisition comes in the wake of a RadiumOne buyout attempt, reported by Re/code, which was rebuffed by management. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0hBA0q0U0BAL0PD02> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic Stunt 

On Monday, DailyMail.com ran a full-page ad in The New York Times business section to promote…programmatic advertising. The offer reads like a buy-one, get-one-free deal to help the publisher sell more ads programmatically. Any company or media-buying agency that spends $150,000 or more on ads bought manually will be credited the same sum to purchase ads programmatically from DailyMail.com. The promotion also aims to increase the UK- based publisher’s business stateside, according to Daily Mail NA CEO Jon Steinberg. “We have a giant audience, people love the site, but we're very much an up and comer on the radar of the agency community," Steinberg told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqHB0g2LW004D0P0AA60V00> . The WSJ’s Mike Shields follows up directly with Steinberg on the effects of the “stunt” here (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PIB00000AV4Dq02gW70> . 

Must-See TV, According To Twitter 

Nielsen surfaced a study on Monday that may incentivize TV execs to invest more in Twitter. According to Nielsen’s data, activity on Twitter can indicate how successful a TV show may be before it premieres. “The findings do not necessarily mean that Twitter TV activity causes larger audience sizes,” Nielsen clarifies in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P840V0DJAgq2> . “But, even if the relationship isn’t causal, our current and recent research efforts increasingly indicate that Twitter TV activity and reach data can help networks and agencies make superior, data-driven advertising and program marketing decisions.” 

Social Spend Will Soar 

Speaking of investing in social, data from Salesforce suggests marketers plan to grow their social media ad spend by 70% in 2015, including mobile spots on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and others. “One of the fears I had was that since social media advertising grew, you might see some brands fail to recognize you have to support the organic side of it as well," said Salesforce VP of marketing insights Jeff Rohrs. "Otherwise, those advertisements won't perform. But it looks like the advertising will be complemented by the organic side." Adweek has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0gKA0000q0D920LAWV> . 

Sweet Beacon Music 

Location meets recommendation. In an announcement first teased at CES in Las Vegas last week, audio recognition app Shazam announced that it’s going to integrate its SDK into beacon provider Gimbal’s software to enable advertisers to recommend songs based on a person’s location. You’re walking down an aisle looking at soap brands and your phone gets pinged with a recommendation for “When Doves Cry”? Could be. In the words of Gimbal CEO Rocco Fabiano, the partnership is about “marrying the digital experience with the physical world.” Read more via The Next Web <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0VA0DB0Wa2Lq00gA00L4P0> . 

Data Privacy Bill Of Rights 

Speaking to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, President Obama said the White House will unveil its long-time-coming data privacy “bill of rights” in February. An additional act that prohibits advertising to students will be included. “Data collected on students in the classroom should only be used for educational purposes, to teach our children, not to market to our children,” Obama said. But some privacy advocates have lingering doubts that the forthcoming bill will actually inhibit data-collection companies. “While the 'Bill of Rights' incorporates high-minded principles, we fear that at the end of the day, legislation will sanction our ever-growing data collection status quo,” said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Twitter’s Video Ads Mashup 

Twitter is gearing up to introduce a new video ad product, according to Ad Age’s sources. Purportedly, the offering would resemble a mashup of Facebook’s autoplay video ads and YouTube’s pay-for-plays strategy. The product would autoplay promoted video ads for six seconds in the feed, and Twitter users would click through to play the videos in full. Advertisers would only be charged for fully watched videos. Ad Age’s Tim Peterson points out that only charging advertisers for fully watched videos could qualify views, and therefore boost viewability rates. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PJB00000AR4Dq02gWc0> . Related: Twitter ad network plans from The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Shields <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWd400K0ABD00R0gL02P0Aq> . 

NYT Programmatic Update 

In an interview with The Media Briefing late last week, New York Times EVP of advertising Meredith Kopit Levien touched on the publisher’s programmatic trajectory. “We take automated buying and selling very seriously and we needed to do quite a bit of work in 2014 on the plumbing underneath that, making it easier technologically, and to do private and preferred programmatic deals,” she said. Looking forward, Levien said programmatic as a percentage of total business will grow modestly in 2015. “This year our CPMs are going up. ... We’re selling better than we have in a long time on the direct side. Next year that will be an even bigger part of our business." More <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWR4gA00LL0PB0e2> . 

Social Abides 

Data from the Pew Research Center <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0gqW0D00MAfB0R4PA>  shows Facebook growth is slowing in the US, though it remains the most popular social network in the US. Despite a decrease in growth, daily engagement on Facebook hit 70%, up from 63% a year ago. Meanwhile, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Twitter usage is growing substantially. “What the numbers don’t reveal was the time people spent on each service,” points out NYT tech reporter Vindu Goel <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LRg2NADP0g00A0> , “Because most social networks generate revenue from advertising, more time on the service means a greater opportunity for visitors to see ads.” 

Native Standards 

In a roundup-style piece on native advertising projections for 2015, The Drum pools opinions from media agency, publisher, brand and vendor execs. Maxus head of digital strategy Tom Dunn says standardization issues will continue to plague native advertising, but that’s a blessing in disguise. “That lack of standardisation is also a fantastic USP,” Dunn says. “If native ads looked the same wherever they appear, they wouldn’t be native. And standardising native ads risks removing that which makes them so appealing – namely, seamless integration with the experience.” This particular debate is far from over.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

About The (B2B) Data 

Business insights giant Dun & Bradstreet has dropped $125 million in cash on B2B data marketing and analytics company NetProspex. “This acquisition fills a growing need for marketers by providing an actionable view of companies and the people who run them, putting quality relationship insight at the center of their marketing data strategy,” said Bob Carrigan, CEO of D&B. The deal comes only weeks after Oracle swooped in on Datalogix and months after LinkedIn bought B2B data platform Bizo. B2B data: the new black.

Les Moonves Eyes Programmatic 

Speaking at the CES Brand Matters Keynote Panel, MediaLink CEO Michael Kassan asked CBS President and CEO Leslie Moonves how programmatic is changing the dialogue between networks and advertisers. “In terms of programmatic ways of selling advertising, obviously we have more and more inventory as each day goes by, as our audiences grow and as our interactive groups grow,” responded Moonves. “So programmatic becomes more and more a part of the dialogue. I know we’re working with some of the various groups that are doing that and I think that’s only going to continue.” Though he added, "Data is spectacular. Having said that, research only becomes part of your decision-making. ... There still has to be the human element that says, 'This is damn good.'"

Flying Solo 

Writing for MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00g05M0WxDP0L0A00> , Adaptly President Sean O'Neal says media is barreling toward autonomy. “We may soon see a tipping point of brands bringing their digital media buying in-house,” writes O’Neal. P&G, Netflix, Kellogg’s, Experian, Thrillist, Allstate, Fidelity, StubHub, 1-800-Flowers and Amazon are already there. But O’Neal says agencies won’t evaporate. “There will be an explosion of new in-house agencies which will have access to all the same tools, talent, and technology,” he adds. “While individual brands won’t have the ‘consolidating buying power’ that the big agency groups do, the intuitive sense of their own marketing combined with their ability to move with speed will all lead to strong ROI.” 

App-tropolis 

2014 was a rock-solid year for Apple’s app store. Billings rose 50% to total $10 billion in revenue for developers. “This year is off to a tremendous start after a record-breaking year for the App Store and our developer community,” commented Apple SVP of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/lMBqy000LgDP0A2A400060W> . “The developer community has now earned over $25 billion.” And, where there’s app money there’s marketing dollars. 

Google Shrinks An Inch 

Following the swapping of Google for Yahoo as Firefox’s default search engine, Yahoo Search use in the US has quadrupled, according to data from Irish analytics firm StatCounter. On Jan. 6, Yahoo Search’s share of usage on Mozilla was 32.2%, up from just 7.5% on the same day one year ago. And during that time frame, Google’s search share fell from 86.1% to 60.8%. Google’s overall U.S. search share dropped from 79.3% to 75.2%. A slightly shorter giant. Computerworld has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLMW70APgz020qD40> .

Children’s Privacy Predictions 

The FTC and regulators are cracking down on sites and apps made for children, but Allison Fitzpatrick, a partner at the Davis & Gilbert law firm, cautions the ad industry at large. Writing for Ad Age, Fitzpatrick offers six predictions for how COPPA regulations will heat up in 2015. Mobile apps and social networking sites will face increased scrutiny, according to Fitzpatrick, and ad targeting may be challenged. “In announcing new-COPPA, former FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz noted the agency's concerns about tracking children to build massive profiles for behavioral advertising purposes,” she writes. “We can expect to see at least one of the next FTC COPPA actions involving behavioral advertising to children.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0g00MqCa> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Long Live The Shakeout 

After a year of intense M&A, in particular around DMPs and video platforms, 2015 may bring even more deal activity, Jack Marshall reports for The Wall Street Journal. Luma Partners’ Terry Kawaja is quoted, saying the current field of scaled online ad platforms is not sustainable. “I don’t know what the right number is, but it’s probably less than 10,” he said, adding, “Dialogue around M&A deals is picking up rapidly.” Translation: Some investors want exits. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0IWD0L8000B4000gK>  

M&A Review 

Just how frantic was consolidation in 2014? I-banker Jordan Edmiston Group’s 2014 year-end M&A report identified 602 transactions in the marketing services and technology area, totalling $39.7 billion. That represents a 26% increase in deal volume and a 71% increase in value. In other words, deals proliferated during the year, but average price as well. Might be early to use the word “shakeout.” Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0g00Iq9L> . A similar year-end report from Coady Diemar Partners highlights the largest video ad tech buys of the year. Read AdExchanger’s coverage on that <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0gaA0q0M0BAL0PDI2> . 

The Most Durable Game 

The Super Bowl is fast approaching, and the record-high $4.4 million to $4.5 million price tag for a :30 spot isn’t dissuading brands. NBC has already unloaded 95% of the ad space. Digital Super Bowl ad sales have also been selling, and have doubled since 2012, Adweek reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/qgAW0A0DLb004I02B0PN00q> . "Frankly I wish we had more capacity there," NBC sales chief Seth Winter told the publication. “We could do a very good job." The biggest-reach, least-targeted ad buy of all time still has a halo. 

Pure Mobile Data 

Street Fight talks to several mobile analytics platforms, some of which migrated to an ad network model after facing challenges scaling up their pure data businesses. “One of the biggest problems is that companies often do not have the budgets for data," said PlaceIQ CEO Duncan McCall. "They may have budgets for media with data, but not data on its own.” And then there's the loss of control: "We were just throwing our data over the wall to the third party and hoping all worked well.” Others, such as Placed CEO David Shim, see hope for pure-play analytics as smartphone use continues to race forward. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0gqW0D00cAOB0I4PA>

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Buffing Google’s Video 

Google will begin reporting on the viewability of video ad campaigns, including ads that run on the Google Display Network and YouTube, head of video and display ad products Neal Mohan said during a presentation at CES in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Google is backing the industry standard of 50% in-view for at least two seconds (a standard that has been called inadequate by Unilever and GroupM). Neal sweetened the pot in a followup blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/TT0WF0P0g000DBy20L4qAA0> :  ”Later in the year, we also plan to report on audibility for video ads, as well as the total amount of time an ad was viewable.” (Related comic!) <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0F0P4qA02000WLz0U0AgDB>  Separately, Google announced initial partners for its “Partner Select” curated video offering. They include CBS Interactive, Fox News, Discovery and Animal Planet. 

Rumored AOL Takeover 

Bloomberg reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0gVA0000q0DA20LAWF>  that Verizon is eyeing digital media companies as potential takeover or joint venture targets, and that the company has looked at AOL. “Verizon needs a digital response and AOL has shown the best strategic foresight of navigating the digital-video world,” Laura Martin, senior analyst at Needham & Co., told the outlet. “Verizon can buy or build that, but it’s unlikely to build it fast enough.” Quartz tech editor Dan Frommer chimes in <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0gWA0000q0DB20LAWF> , “While the companies overlap in several places, the most logical explanation for any possible deal is that Verizon sees mobile as the future of video.” But Verizon’s own CEO denied the rumor in comments at the Citi media conference. Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0gX0B4L0C2AAP00q0DF00> . 

Medium On Measurement 

Medium CEO Ev Williams pens a think piece on the Internet’s attention war and Medium’s approach to measuring engagement. According to WIlliams, the danger of relying on monthly uniques or sudden upticks in traffic is that it can represent unengaged users. Medium’s top-line metric is TTR, or total time reading. But measuring time is also imperfect. “The problem with time is it’s not actually measuring value,” writes Williams. “It’s measuring cost as a proxy for value. Advertisers don’t really want your time?—?they want to make an impression on your mind, consciously or subconsciously (and, ultimately, your money).” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02D000YF00gPW04DABAqL0> . 

A Programmatic Future 

PubMatic surfaced with a forward-looking report that touches on, among other things, how business can navigate media tech’s walled gardens, programmatic campaign measurement and best practices for mobile. “Programmatic has moved beyond just transactions and RTB,” said PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DEA02000BWF0q4gZLP0A> . “And it is touching both direct and indirect sales channels and reaching more consumption channels, from desktop and mobile to connected TVs. Undoubtedly, programmatic will play a role in accelerating new digital channels such as wearables or even self-driving cars.” Go here for the report <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0g00B4L0F2AAP00q0DF00> . 

WPP In The Game 

WPP is looking to beef up its sports and content arsenal, and on Tuesday led a $250 million investment round in sports marketing agency Bruin Sports Capital. George Pyne, former president of sports and entertainment at IMG Worldwide, is pioneering the agency, which has already racked up $500 million in buying power. “WPP's investment in sports and content through Bruin Sports Capital is an important part of its strategy as it impacts new markets, new media, data investment management and the application of technology and horizontality," commented WPP Chief Sir Martin Sorrell in a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00FA0L0DG00gB2qW0A1P04> .

AdExchanger Research analysts will unveil two new reports on digital marketing technology. On Day 1, Joanna O'Connell looks at the future of TV - is 2015 the year TV starts to go programmatic? Meanwhile, on Day 2, Melissa Parrish reviews the unmet promises of mobile and what's in store for marketers in the year ahead.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

AOL Divided 

AOL’s business has long been divided between its premium content and ad tech divisions. Ad Age reports the latter may be winning out amid a management shakeup. The org changes are meant to seize on AOL’s “biggest growth opportunities,” a spokesman told Ad Age in an email. An unnamed source chimes in, “[AOL is] doubling down on programmatic and video so it does raise the question, if you're not in those two areas at AOL, what are you doing?” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PPB00000AA4Dq02gWz0> . 

YouTube As Negotiating Chip 

Google may be wielding its super-desirable YouTube inventory as a cudgel to drive adoption of its ad tech products, according to Digiday’s John McDermott <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0AgA00QAD0AP00040> . Citing unnamed sources, McDermott reports, “Google wanted Mondel?z to use DoubleClick Bid Manager, Google’s demand-side buying platform <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0BgA00RAD0AP00040> , instead of competitor TubeMogul, to execute the YouTube transactions as part of the deal, and it was using YouTube’s TrueView pricing system as leverage.” The negotiation eventually led to a deal where the snack giant’s YouTube spend would be split between platforms. 

Scout Master 

Scout Media promoted Ramsey McGrory to president of sales and publishing for the company, a media network focused on men’s sporting. McGrory is the former CEO of AddThis, prior to which he led Right Media. "Like many premium publishers, programmatic is new for Scout, but I think it goes well beyond the simple non-guaranteed inventory strategy or reach extension," McGrory told AdExchanger when he was hired just five months ago <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0SL0000AP02BAqDg0C40A> . "I believe programmatic means the fusion of technology and data to deliver great ad, content and commerce experiences for consumers." 

Timberland Reboots 

Timberland is using data science to reinvent its product design and marketing globally, The Washington Post reports. “The company says that the cornerstone of the comeback has been a two-year customer study in which it collected data from 18,000 people across eight countries,” according to the Post. “Timberland was able to diagnose its problems and to zero in on its ideal customer — an urban dweller with a casual interest in the outdoors.” More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0gTA0q0D0BAL0PDA2>  

Platinum Data 

Havas is teaming up with Universal Music Group for consumer data mining. The so-called Global Music Data Alliance aims to find correlations between musicians, listeners and brands, and to apply those insights to advertising.The move mirrors Warner Music Group’s partnership with interactive media company Interlude, announced in December. “Arguably, this is an indication of a positive trend towards more ‘scientific’ management of music activities,” Bernstein Research analyst Claudio Aspesi tells the Financial  <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0g00AqUE> Times.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Snapcash 

Snapchat closed a hefty $486 million investment round, auspiciously announced in a regulatory filing on New Year’s Eve. The 23 investors are so far unnamed, though the Financial Times says Yahoo and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers are rumored backers. “Despite the huge valuation and new funding, the company's advertising business remains in its nascent stages,” writes Financial Times reporter Tim Bradshaw at CNBC.com, “with only a handful of brands paying to promote themselves on Snapchat's ephemeral messaging app so far.” But the funding vindicates Snapchat’s refusal to sell to Facebook for $3 billion last year. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DoA02000BWx0q4gBLP0A> . 

Optimizing The Brand Chats 

Speaking of chat apps, TechCrunch reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0pxgWPC0A00>  says the genre is creating value for brands. Line, WeChat and Kik are among the big purveyors. (As AdExchanger reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWx4gA00DL0PB0q2> , Kik opened the door to branded chats this year.) TechCrunch’s Jon Russell sees Asia leading the chat charge. “Asia’s messaging apps have been around longer, and thus most have more mature business models that generate income by connecting brands with consumers, in addition to other non-marketing revenue streams such as games and stickers,” writes Russell. 

Yahoo’s Jingling Pockets 

Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer is rumored to be eying cable networks, sources tell Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000x2rg0L0B0EA4PDAq> . The company has eyed Scripps Networks Interactive and CNN. The Information’s Tom Dolan chimes in on the CNN rumor with a speculative piece, calling a merger between a tech and cable company “preordained.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00xA0L0Ds00gB2qW0AFP04> . And Yahoo is also reportedly sniffing around demand-side players including Mediamath and Turn. Re/code from November. <http://go.adexchanger.com/ut0000DB4L0A0G02xPqWAg0>  

Stream Nation 

TV everywhere is…really everywhere. According to data from Leichtman Research Group, more than three-quarters of US households own a DVR, subscribe to Netflix or use video on demand from cable or telco providers. “While VOD and DVRs were relatively nascent when this series of studies began, they are now core components of pay-TV packages,” says Bruce Leichtman, president and principal analyst for LRG. “Along with Netflix and other over-the-top offerings, these on-Demand [sic] TV services have permanently changed the options of how people may choose to watch TV.” And, where there’s smoke in the form of end-user behavioral shifts, there’s bound to be fire in the form of new paid-media inventory. Multichannel has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0ugA00HxD0AP00040> . 

Stay Tuned 

Speaking to Beet.TV, Xaxis CEO Brian Lesser said 2014 was a milestone year for Xaxis’ TV biz. “When we started Xaxis in 2011, about 80% of what we did was display and we had a small video business,” he said. “Now it’s the majority of what we do.” Lesser claims Xaxis growth into television will give it a leg up once programmatic for linear TV becomes technologically feasible. “Our ambition is to convert what is now a very big video business to eventually dovetail that with a TV business that we buy programmatically,” Lesser said.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Gurbaksh Calling 

Re/code’s Kara Swisher reports on an effort by former RadiumOne CEO Gurbaksh Chahal to buy the company that fired him. The offer from his “marketing operating system” company, Gravity4, reportedly values RadiumOne at less than 1x revenue for 2014. Management said in its rebuttal, “RadiumOne will continue with its current plans to build an enduring and substantial company under the steady hand of existing leadership.” Chahal, who remains the company’s largest shareholder in the wake of domestic violence allegations that unseated him last year, may be counting on jittery investors. He warns the board needs to accept that ad tech is in its “consolidation phase.” Sell now! More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PWB00000As4Dq02gWO0>  

Deflating Do-Not-Track 

Is Do-Not-Track dead yet? In an op-ed for The New York Times, Fred Campbell checks in on the four-year-old effort to create a browser-based opt-out mechanism for ad tracking. Campbell focuses on a proposal by Internet heavyweights like Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Google and Yahoo to exempt their first-party cookies from complying. “Large companies that operate both first- and third-party businesses would be able to use data they gather through their first-party relationships to compete in the third-party ad market.” And he says the job shouldn’t be left to the Federal Trade Commission. “The correct balance between privacy and competition is a decision better left to Congress than to a feckless regulator.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLsWP0APgX020qD40> . But, it may be the world has left Do-Not-Track and its desktop-centric assumptions behind. 

Challenging YouTube 

In the world of web video, YouTube is king. But Facebook is looking strong in the wake of major 2014 investments, including an alliance with the NFL and the acquisition of LiveRail.. “Facebook is already a place where you consume content, and now they are dialing up video,” Fullscreen President Ezra Cooperstein told the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02Q000Ys00gPW04DABAqL0> . “This is a year where YouTube is still the dominant platform for emerging talent. It’s going to be challenged [in 2015], and Facebook has to crack [ads]. It could be pretty dangerous for YouTube if Facebook does crack that.” But Facebook’s long-term ad strategy will have to evolve for it to compete with Google’s platform, said Vik Kathuria, global chief media officer at Razorfish. 

Viewability 2015 

Adweek tapped brand and agency execs for perspective on the ad viewability trend. “What the last couple of months of ongoing conversation has done for us, in terms of our ad buys, is make us smarter buyers of publishers,” said Kevin Scholl, digital marketing director at Red Roof Inn. “We've taken a step back and looked at where we are serving our [ads]. If we were buying in spaces with lame guarantees, we had to question continue buying there—or evolve how we were buying.” Jared Belsky, president of 360i, adds, "Our goal going into 2015 should continue to be to push the limits and focus on high-quality, verifiable and measurable media for clients in order to eliminate risk and make strides toward that industry mission." Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/FgDBL00RZ0W0P2sq000AA04> . 

The Gift Of Pinterest 

Pinterest’s paid media product, Promoted Pins, is ready for the big time. After eight months of testing, the offering will roll out to all ad partners. Beta results with brand advertisers such as Banana Republic and Target were positive, delivering a 30% bump in earned media. Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/gS0D40L0q20gBA0AW0000sP> . But Pinterest has its work cut out when it comes to addressability, according to Kinetic Social CEO Don Mathis. “Deeper targeting will make Pinterest a big player and potentially catapult the platform onto the same stage as Twitter and Facebook,” writes Mathis for Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPgT4B00W000qAs0020A1D> .


Content Ops 

In a list of predictions for digital advertising in 2015, Skimlink CEO Alicia Navarro says programmatic targeting of content is coming. “In 2015, we’ll see a critical mass of publishers begin to leverage behavioral data to programmatically target content to optimize experiences for users on publishers’ sites,” writes Navarro for VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW02L0000sP02BAqDg0U40A> .
