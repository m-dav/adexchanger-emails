News Round Up

Noto Speaks 

Ad Age tapped Twitter CFO Anthony Noto for an update on the firm’s marketing strategy and the search for a new CMO. “We have the best aggregated real-time content in the world,” Noto said. “The value of Twitter is that we give people both the opportunity to find out what's happening right now, but also we give them a microphone to project globally what they find of interest and their points of view. And we're trying to encapsulate both of those value propositions into a marketing campaign that brings that message to the masses.” On the CMO front, Noto said Twitter is “moving aggressively” to hire an exec, but wouldn’t give a timeline.

Not LinkedOut 

Is LinkedIn creating a closed publishing ecosystem? If a 44% decline in referral traffic to 1,000 publishers measured by SimpleReach is any indicator, LinkedIn may be prioritizing its own media and contributor network, writes Lucia Moses of Digiday. LinkedIn has ramped up its content efforts for well over a year (read AdExchanger coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00JA0L0DS00wB2qW0AxP04> ) and rolled out formats like self-serve Sponsored Updates for publishers. With LinkedIn’s investment in the Pulse news app, and subsequent editorial hires, it appears to be angling for more engagement – within its own four walls. More at Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0w0TWD0L4Py0A2q0J0BA00> . 

Programmatic TV Level Up 

IDC forecasts worldwide programmatic TV ad spend will hit $17.3 billion by 2019, up from $69 million in 2014. IDC also says programmatic ad spend on linear TV will outpace spend on both streaming video and RTB. “If programmatic TV picks up the way it’s projected, it could be the ideal spot for those frustrated marketers to dump budgets,” writes MediaPost’s Tyler Loechner. Major footnote: The Trade Desk sponsored IDC’s report.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0w0UWD0L4Pz0A2q0J0BA00> Read on. 

Difference In Opinion 

Privacy concerns are slowing ad targeting in Europe, Ashley Swartz, CEO of TV ad-management platform Furious Corp., tells Beet.TV. “Although programmatic and automation is accelerated more so in Europe than [In the US], adoption of addressability and targeting down to an individual level is much slower to evolve,” she said. One reason: Individual countries have differing opinions on the use of third-party data, whereas the US is homogenized. But Europe is ahead of the US on smart TV and OTT adoption, according to Swartz.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LJV2AADP0w00A0> More. 

Using Users 

When concerns in the developer or app publisher community confront user privacy concerns, developers lose. Google doesn’t disagree, according to Re/code’s Mark Bergen, but that hasn’t stopped it from showing developers how to maneuver around Apple’s new security protocols (which disable mobile ads outside of publishers not running advanced security measures). It serves as an important reminder that, when push comes to shove, Google is an ad business and Apple is not.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0WB02q0L0AB0Dw00AJ4> Read on. 

The Variable Pricing Bogeyman 

Companies in international markets are experimenting with tech that adjusts ecommerce prices in real time based on knowledge of consumers. For high-margin items, for instance, a brand can up its profit considerably by giving different price points to different consumer segments. In Europe, which has emerged as the digital world’s regulatory petri dish, a paper from the University of Amsterdam Institute for Information Law examines the legality of that kind of market manipulation – and whether the user knowledge it displays is contrary to data protection standards.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PCBXD000qA2J04L0w> More.

News Round Up

GroupM’s Abuzz 

On Monday, GroupM inked a three-year partnership with BuzzFeed that gives WPP agencies and their clients access to BuzzFeed data. The partnership, which The Guardian values at some tens of millions of dollars, gets GroupM a team of dedicated staffers embedded in BuzzFeed Motion Pictures, preferential rates and exclusive access to Pound, the publisher’s proprietary data and analytics platform. So what’s in it for BuzzFeed? Guaranteed ad spend. WPP chief Martin Sorrell says GroupM will secure for the publisher a portion of the $76 billion it spends annually. “This is a big deal for us in terms of our strategic growth,” said Kate Burns, GM of BuzzFeed’s Euro operations. “We treat all our partners equally, and hopefully there will be more agency deals to come.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0wAAh0DKB00> More. 

Digital Campaign Trails 

Political campaign spending is at an all-time high in the long lead up to 2016’s presidential election, which bodes well for digital publishers. According to data from Borrell Associates, political campaign spend is up 20% over 2012’s election cycle, which shakes out to candidates spending north of $50 per eligible voter. NBC News says politicians are turning to programmatic to track online user behavior and target their ads. “There's only a quarter of a million people tops that are going to impact the next election,” The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green told NBC News. "Digital gives you the ability to speak to the right issues to the right people."  <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0wi0B4L0L2AAP00q0DB00> Read on. 

Post-Game Analysis 

Last year, Facebook struck a deal with the NFL and Verizon to test the quality of post-roll video, and it appears the experiment has come to a close. The partnership showcased NFL clips on Facebook’s news feed, with ads from Verizon tacked onto the end of each minute-long clip. “Several media companies privately expressed their doubts about the post-roll treatment when it was launched,” the Journal’s Mike Shields points out. “And Facebook never seemed to get many other takers as top advertisers continued to gravitate to pre-roll ads on other sites or standalone video ads on Facebook.” Cue the NFL launching its first YouTube channel earlier this year.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0B0P4qA02000WLM0j0AwDB> Read it.

According to research from the CMO Club and IBM, marketers are thinking less and less of budgets as divvied up between distinct marketing channels (TV, radio, print, social, online, etc.) in favor of an approach that emphasizes cohesive customer journeys. Based on a survey of ad buyers spending $1 billion or more, The Drum’s Minda Smiley cites CMO Club CEO Peter Krainik, who sees “feedback metrics that allow for rapid experimentation” as an important driver of that change.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0wkA0000q0DN20LAWB> More. 

Outside The Box 

Not all terrible advertising leads to terrible results. Adweek’s David Griner reports that a recent online campaign from Amnesty International got 11% of viewers to sign a petition demanding the release from prison of a Belarusian human rights activist. The catch? Viewers had their cursors “trapped” within the confines of the banner ad. The cursor wasn’t really trapped, just hidden by a top layer so it was invisible beyond the confines of the banner unit. But hey, at least someone (besides ad-block companies) can benefit from crappy UX.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bw00lW2A000040BB0DOLPqA> Read on.

News Round Up

Tepid Spots 

Jonathan Mayer, a computer scientist at Stanford and occasional privacy advocate, uncovered an ad abnormality running through AT&T hotspots at Dulles International Airport. While browsing the Internet through an AT&T portal, Mayer noticed ad-supported websites like The Wall Street Journal displaying additional pop-up ads. The ads were facilitated through an ad injection platform called RaGaPa, a startup that pitches network monetization. “The legality of hotspot advertising injection is a messy subject,” Mayer wrote  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000x2Vw0L0B0oA4PDAq> via Web Policy. “It certainly doesn’t help AT&T and RaGaPa that the ads aren’t labeled as associated with the hotspot, and that AT&T’s wifi terms of service are silent about advertising injection.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqpP04A0LB0WAx02w0000WD> Re/code follows up with AT&T, who says the ads were part of an experiment that is now over. 

“M”essenger 

Facebook introduced a service called “M” in a blog post on Wednesday by David Marcus, the former PayPal president and current Facebook VP of messaging products. Marcus says “M” is “powered by artificial intelligence that's trained and supervised by people.” It’s clear that the product is in a testing phase, but the stated goal is to use AI to enable purchases, book restaurants, order deliveries, set calendar notices and more.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00q0XL0xW00AD2q0wA04> Check out the full post. How long until paid media scales up within messaging apps? 

Caught In A Web 

Venrock partner and prominent VC investor David Pakman (Klout, Nest, Singly, Dstillery) wrote a Medium post about how “The currency of the media business is attention.” Pakman says brands and marketers should be hyperfocused on apps (which absorb 86% of all user attention on mobile, with browsers picking up 14%). Bolstered by recent research data, Pakman ventures, “The idea that the mobile web is a credible channel through which to reach consumers is largely disproven at this point.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/irxW00BwPYL00A000Dq2A04> Read it. 

Ranting On Ratings 

On a call Wednesday with US investors, WPP CEO Martin Sorrell said he’d like to see more “cooperation” between Rentrak and comScore, and later that he’d “welcome them coming together.” There are concerns across the industry – from the marketer side in particular – about the Tower of Babel proliferation of metrics. Measurement is difficult when services miss or overlap in global regions or across marketing channels (TV, mobile, online), or if multiple services have strongly diverging results. The Wall Street Journal’s Nathalie Tadena and Sarah Rabil posit that a Rentrak/comScore team-up could contend better with Nielsen.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4x0s0P00qD002LBW0ZAw> Read on. 

High Five 

Forbes published a list calling out five ad tech firms to know, and AdRoll, Tapad, MediaMath and StartApp all made the cut. The fifth firm, Oomph, is a lesser-known startup that helps traditional print publishers transition to digital by transforming print ads to digital formats. “The service is valuable because it slashes cost and time of print-to-digital translation and allows publishers to sell ads across both print and mobile platforms in a single transaction, instead of through separate deals for each media,” writes Forbes contributor Ilya Pozin.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ywyWDqP00A0LAB004u00020> Read it.

News Round Up

Adblock’s Mainstream Moment   

Howard Stern discovered Adblock Plus on his Tuesday morning show, and Google registered a  <http://go.adexchanger.com/qwAW0A0DLs004t02B0P300q> noticeable uptick in queries. “Gary, contact my IT person and tell ’em I want that,” he said. "I'm sitting through all these ads and you're telling me there's a way to avoid ’em?" In a post on Medium, Deep Focus CEO Ian Schafer shares the audio and opines, "I don’t think we’ll be able to convince people that ads are what makes the world go round, in the same way we couldn’t convince people that piracy is bad. What we need to do is find a better way."  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0tL0000tP02BAqDw0440A> More. 

Big Country, Big Data 

An article published by the South China Morning Post details the rise of big data use in the region. Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent are leading the big data charge in China, though each has cornered a niche (Alibaba in ecommerce, Baidu in search and Tencent in social media). “In the big picture, I would say big data and all of what that entails is being massively embraced by China, by the Chinese government, by the internet companies,” said David Sullivan, an analyst at Alliance Development Group. “They were and probably are a little behind Google and Amazon, but they started a little bit later. Right now, they’re starting to establish more R&D centers, they’re putting more dollars behind it.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLtW50APwu020qD40> More. 

Beacon Chic 

Fashion mag Elle has partnered with beacon firm Swirl to bring targeted messaging to consumers in brick-and-mortars. While that’s not novel, Elle’s approach is a departure from the norm. Typically, retailers control the ads launched from the apps they’re associated with, or at least are involved in design concepts. Elle, however, will act as an aggregator for brands looking to reach mobile shoppers. “The key here is that Elle has the ability to send mobile messages from brands to in-market shoppers when they’re within range of a store that carries that brand,” explains MediaPost’s Chuck Martin.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/o026000vt00wPW04DABAqL0> Read more. 

SEC And ROI 

According to a  <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00t70ALAWPwwB02q000> document released on Monday, the SEC at one stage wanted to know how Twitter plans to measure user engagement and ad effectiveness in place of its abandoned “timeline views.” The WSJ’s Yoree Koh notes that the SEC has dropped its inquiry, though Twitter wouldn’t comment on the reasons for the change or if the inquiry affected disclosures. Twitter CFO Anthony Noto said on an investor call earlier this year that the company is looking to things like the number of private messages and the share of users who sign in daily (which is strong, as opposed to the overall user growth) as engagement indicators.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4t0x0P00qD002LBW08Aw> More. 

Haters And Creators 

Facebook video views are up from 1 billion per day last September to more than 4 billion per day in April (and growing). Ironically, that burst of online video viewership has been a painful setback for digital video creators, explains Time’s Victor Luckerson. There’s been a steady  <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLtW90APwy020qD40> drip,  <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pa40t0DzAwq2> drip of creator blowback against Facebook for allowing copyright infringement on its platform. Google had a similar problem with YouTube early on, but addressed the issue when Viacom sued for a billion dollars. It’s possible that Facebook requires more prodding than angry tweets and Medium posts.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/TA0Wt0P0w000DBb20L4qAA0> Read on.

News Round Up

Mobile Revenues Lag 

The consumer migration to mobile is outpacing publishers’ mobile ad revenue, The Wall Street Journal reports. But as publishers struggle to bring sophisticated tracking and targeting tools to mobile, online giants are cleaning up. Facebook, for one, accounted for 37% of total US mobile ad revenue last year, according to eMarketer, in part due to its trove of user data. The New York Times is one publisher navigating the challenge. “[Mobile revenues] are definitely lagging audience. No question,” said NYT CRO Meredith Kopit Levien. Investing in sponsored content is one solution, and partnering with Facebook could be another (though Facebook might have the upper hand). “We want our mobile revenue number to move a lot faster, but it is moving in the right direction,” Levien said.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0PmwWP70A00> More. 

Fighting In The Dark 

Agencies are trying to figure out what the new special sauce is as brands continue to express displeasure (privately and publicly, in the form of media reviews) with existing models. Ad Age reporter Alexandra Bruell asks, “Do [brands] want rebundling? Unbundling? A completely new model?” One thing is clear: “We're not going back to a one-stop shop,” says MediaLink CEO Michael Kassan. Even if the old agency model turns out to work best, expect heightened competition in Agency Land.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4m080P00qD002LBW0QAw> More. 

Making Hay 

Concerns are mounting that VC and private equity money is running dry for ad and mar tech companies. With the stock market taking a beating (particularly media and technology firms), Re/code’s Carmela DeAmicis interviews a few founders in the space for perspective on funding and tech investment. Some of the tips include refocusing on enterprise clientele (who are themselves more likely to weather a market crash than SMBs), and to take advantage of the down periods to make lower-cost investments in talent and tech.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4m090P00qD002LBW0RAw> Read on. 

Playing With Programmatic 

Writing for Nieman Journalism Lab, Joseph Lichterman explores how podcasters are partnering to support programmatic advertising. But it’s early days. “Podcasting is based on very old technologies, and it hasn’t changed for at least 10 years,” said Jason Cox, CEO of Audiometric, a firm that does dynamic ad insertion for podcasts. “When we set out to develop the ad-insertion technology, the rule for us was that it should work through any platform. … To do that, we had to modify the actual audio file at the time it’s requested by the user.” With that pipe dream in mind, others like Midroll Media are looking to subscription services to boost their podcast biz.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000m2Sw0L0B0aA4PDAq> Read it.   

All Together Now 

Writing for Campaign, AOL UK’s managing director, Hamish Nicklin, says the acceleration of ad tech calls for greater collaboration. As an example, Nicklin points to the recent partnership between AOL and Microsoft. “From getting in early on the briefing process to delivering campaigns with creativity, innovation and rich data and insights, collaboration has truly redefined advertising in the digital age,” Nicklin writes. More to the point, Nicklin claims the AOL-Microsoft coupling aims to expand advertiser reach across desktop, mobile and video, as consumption habits on those channels continue to evolve.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PbB00000Am4Dq02wWT0> More.

Down The Tubes 

August has been a tough month for media stocks, and last week may have been worst of all. The WSJ’s Nathalie Tadena reports that Time Warner and Disney have been downgraded by Bernstein, and companies like Viacom, 21st Century Fox and even Netflix had crushing tumbles on the market. As linear TV disintegrates, analysts are calling for “a new framework to value the media sector.” And until that framework is in place, investors are hesitant to bet on which media sectors will regrow.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/FwDBL00ds0W0P2jq000AA04> Read on. 

Krafting A New Plan 

Sources tell Adweek that Kraft Foods Group is expected to put its media business up for review. If true, it’s another hit for incumbent agency Starcom, which has lately defended its accounts with Mars, Anheuser Busch InBev and Samsung. Kantar Media puts Kraft’s marketing spend (for clients like Oscar Mayer, Planters and Maxwell) at $513.8 million in the US last year. Relatedly, Kraft spinoff Mondelez launched a $1.5 billion global review in June.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0wqW0D00tAeB0j4PA> Read on. 

Hear This 

After its privacy policy update made waves late last week, Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek issued a blanket apology blog post to clear the air. Ek’s main message? Our bad. But! “This is not new,” wrote Ek in reference to data sharing with advertisers, rights holders and mobile networks. “Some Spotify subscribers sign up through their mobile provider, which means some information is shared with them by necessity. We also share some data with our partners who help us with marketing and advertising efforts, but this information is de-identified – your personal information is not shared with them. ”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ljBqu000LwDP0A2A4000f0W> Read it. 

Crossing The Stream 

Four companies – Amazon, Apple, Google and Roku – own 86% of the streaming media device market. Roku led the pack with 34% of units sold in 2014. What’s notable is the lack of any traditional media or broadcast player in the category, as linear TV has transitioned rapidly to Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Google Chromecast. This market consolidation puts a huge barrier up for new entrants, and apparently all that remains now is to find out which of these four services can best leverage content and usage on behalf of advertisers.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0jA0DB0Wg2Lq00wA00v4P0> Read on at Broadband TV News. 

Snapchat Winners Come And Go 

Snapchat has repeatedly tinkered with its Discover content portal, and is apparently set to do so again. Mashable and Vox will be given their own Discover channels, according to Ad Age reporter Tim Peterson. It’s still unknown which of the current 10 publishers featured on the Discover product will be bounced to make room for them.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/gh0D40L0q20wBA0AW000wjP> More. Snapchat lets the brands on its Discover page do up to five sponsor takeovers per month, but revenues are still tiny. It made just $3 million in 2014,  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0wxA0000q0Di20LAWj> Gawker revealed last week.

News Round Up

Weathering The Cord Cut 

The Weather Channel is reportedly seeking new ownership and has hired investment bankers to get the job done. But will the cable network’s digital and mobile properties come along for the ride? Perhaps not. According to Bloomberg’s sources, The Weather Co.’s current consortium of owners – Blackstone Group, Bain Capital and NBCUniversal – could offload its digital properties, collectively valued at $3 billion. It’s unclear how Weather’s ad targeting division, AdFX, would be affected since both its cable and digital divisions tap into its trifecta of weather, location and audience data. <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0wjA0000q0Da20LAWd>  Read more. 

Salesforce Marketing Cloud Soars 

On Salesforce.com’s Q2 earnings call, CEO Marc Benioff dropped a few tidbits about the company’s Marketing Cloud performance. Revenue increased by 22% to $157.9 million in the second quarter, up from $122.4 last year. Total revenue in Q2 hit $1.6 billion, a 24% increase YoY. Benioff anticipates the company will surpass $7 billion in revenue by the end of the year. “Microsoft, SAP and Oracle are selling millions of dollars in CRM,” he said. “That’s millions with an ‘M.’ We’re selling billions.” Benioff noted Salesforce doubled its number of large deals for Marketing Cloud year over year. <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0wAAk0Dbd00>  The results. 

Spotify Is Listening 

Spotify switched up its privacy policy on Thursday, granting itself the right to collect a variety of data from its users. In addition to accessing mobile users’ contacts, photos and device sensors, Spotify’s new policy aims to enhance its advertising. Spotify will now share user information with its advertising partners in order to tailor ads and other promotional content. “We may also receive information about you from our service providers and partners,” reads the policy, “which we use to personalise your Spotify experience, to measure ad quality and responses to ads, and to display ads that are more likely to be relevant to you.” User information will be deidentified via hashing.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLdWc0APwl020qD40> More via Forbes. 

Sourcing The News 

According to traffic analytics from Parse.ly, Facebook has usurped Google as the strongest driver of news audiences. The social media giant has gone from “vying” with Google to overtaking it by a significant amount, reports Fortune’s Mathew Ingram. Facebook has been ramping up efforts to absorb news audiences. Meanwhile, Google has instituted new restrictions (such as disallowing publishers from seeing search keyword results) that are pushing news media away from SEO as a traffic source. Parse.ly CTO Andrew Montalenti says that when it comes to article performance, Facebook is “almost as impenetrable” as Google.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/imdW00BwPdL00A000Dq2A04> More. 

Not So Fast 

According to an April poll of marketers by Mox, approval processes are slowing the adoption and implementation of new tech. Of marketers surveyed, 27.7% pointed to a heavily scrutinized and structural approval process for new tech. And a similar study from Business Performance Innovation Network claims tech managers’ biggest hurdle is gaining approval for the adoption of new technology. In yet another hurdle, a majority of global marketing professionals surveyed in April by the Direct Marketing Association say proving the value of new tech is not easy.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0w0eWD0L4Pn0A2q0d0BA00> EMarketer has more. 

A Post-SMS World 

Pew Research Center released its first dedicated study on mobile messaging on Thursday and, according to the data, 36% of smartphone owners use apps like WhatsApp, Kik or iMessage, while 17% use ephemeral messaging apps like Snapchat or Wickr. Unsurprisingly, younger demographics are leading the trend, with 49% of 18-29-year-olds active on messaging apps. Elsewhere in social, 31% of online adults are now active on Pinterest and 28% are active on Instagram. Per Pew, “The results in this report reflect the noteworthy and rapid emergence of different kinds of communications tools serving different social needs.” Next up for advertisers: figuring out how to master marketing on those emerging channels.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPwf4B00W000qAd0020AoD> More. 

GroupM’s Mobile Plans 

Medialets vet Eric Litman is now a GroupM mobile exec. A little over four months after GroupM <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02g000pd00wPW04DABAqL0>  snapped up mobile ad platform Medialets in April, Litman, the company’s former CEO and founder, is officially ensconced within the WPP fold as GroupM’s SVP of mobile worldwide. In a <http://go.adexchanger.com/GwB0Ad20Dq4hW0AL0000P0q>  Facebook post, Litman said that he’ll be largely focused on strategy and M&A. He’ll also be involved in a new business inside GroupM called Connect that “brings together the mobile, social, search and transparent programmatic capabilities of the global org under a single umbrella.” Sounds like a big umbrella. Congrats, Eric.

News Round Up

Symbiosis 

Ad Age’s Jeanine Poggi asked some observers what NBCUniversal’s investments in BuzzFeed and Vox mean for advertising. Jesse Redniss, co-founder of media consultant Brave Ventures, says the deals are mutually beneficial. NBCU lends BuzzFeed and Vox credibility as destinations for news, while BuzzFeed and Vox get NBCU closer to millennial audiences and fresher ad strategies (think: native). Alan Wolk, senior analyst at The Diffusion Group, says the investment also creates opportunities for cross-device campaigns. “To combat some of the device usage that takes place during commercials,” Poggi writes, “NBCU can create ad packages that include ads to run on those sites at the same time they are airing on TV.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0wxA0q0t0BAL0PD82> Read it. 

PayPal’s Modest Purchase 

PayPal snapped up mobile commerce platform Modest, its first acquisition since becoming a standalone company. Notably, Harper Reed is a Modest co-founder. (Reed served as chief technology officer for President Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.) Speaking to VentureBeat, Reed says the exit’s about scale. “If we can build a great product, but can’t push this out to millions, then it’s boring,” Reed said. “We found this amazing cheat code to get to scale.” For its part, PayPal will use Modest for contextual commerce. Terms were not disclosed.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DW84wA00yL0PB0u2> Read on. 

Sunny Skies 

Digital out-of-home ads are up almost a third since last July, according to recent research. The Journal’s Nathalie Tadena reports that, despite representing only 4-5% of total ad spending, OOH sales have increased at a faster rate than other sectors. The market is bolstered by concerns in TV and digital that ads are easily blocked or skipped. The overall trend is still that TV budgets melt at a glacial pace, but it isn’t just mobile and desktop absorbing the runoff.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q08WD0Lz000B4000wv> More. 

Spell Data With A “C” 

According to a survey from Experian and Loudhouse Research, more than half of CIOs expect the volume of data they’re responsible for to grow by at least 33% in the next year. The surge of data at brands’ disposal is leading to another addition to the C-suite, as four out of every 10 CIOs without a CDO expect to add a data-specific executive to the top ranks. According to the research, companies with CDOs excelled in using data to drive decision-making and, interestingly, managing exposure to regulatory risk.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/l8BqA000LwDP0A2A4000w0W> More via Marketer.

News Round Up

Telekom Wants A Cut 

In a piece posted on LinkedIn, Deutsche Telekom’s SVP of tech strategy, Tomasz Gerszberg, takes fire at Internet giants like Google, Facebook and AppNexus. According to Gerszberg, the advertising strategies of large Internet companies eat into mobile subscriber’s data plans. His solution? Companies facilitating advertising for brands through mobile websites and apps should pay carriers a cut to support the ads that drain subscribers’ data. Financial Times digital media correspondent Robert Cookson highlights an important postscript: “Implicit within the proposal is a threat: carriers could block the advertising of intermediaries that refused to pay.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000052gw0L0B0hA4PDAq> More. 

Battle Of The Brands 

Faced with mounting competition from rival JD.com, Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba is scrambling to sign exclusive contracts with high-profile brands, the WSJ reports. Last week, Alibaba took a 20% stake in Chinese electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group (electronics is JD.com’s strongest foothold), and has signed agreements with more than 160 labels this year, 20 of which will sell their merchandise exclusively on Alibaba-owned property Tmall. Haoyu Shen, chief executive of JD Mall, didn’t sugarcoat JD.com’s position. “We are concerned,” he said. “We don’t think it’s in the brand’s interest to do that.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0iL00005P02BAqDw0h40A> Read it. 

NBCUniversal Banks On BuzzFeed 

After putting $200 million into new media publisher Vox ( <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q05WD0Lj000B4000wi> read AdExchanger coverage), NBCUniversal pulled the trigger on a second strategic investment in BuzzFeed – $200 million for undisclosed equity in the viral millennial publisher. In a  <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00L5j2kADP0w00A0> memo to staffers, BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti also referenced a new  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A450l0P00qD002LBW0kAw> joint venture with Yahoo Japan to bring BuzzFeed Japan to Asian markets. BuzzFeed has also inked deals with Facebook’s Instant Articles, Snapchat’s Discover and Apple’s forthcoming news app. “These partnerships allow us to reach a bigger audience and have a bigger impact than what would be possible on our own,” Peretti wrote. As for its broadcast investor, 1.5 billion monthly video views was undoubtedly a draw. 

The Market For Markets 

Only a month after Paypal and eBay officially split, Re/code’s Jason Del Rey reports that eBay is selling off part of its stake in Snapdeal, an Indian ecommerce powerhouse. EBay led a $133.7 million investment in Snapdeal last year. The Drum also  <http://go.adexchanger.com/FwDBL00lm0W0P25q000AA04> reports that eBay has hired a new CMO, and is “redefining itself with a more aggressive focus on retailing.” The online marketplace plans to use at least some of the newly-available funds to reinvest in eBay India.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000052mw0L0B0nA4PDAq> Read on. 

In It For The Short Haul 

Writing for Forbes, Avi Dan, the founder of agency search consulting firm Avidan Strategies, predicts a decline in the agency retainer model. According to Dan, marketers are increasingly enlisting agencies on a project-by-project basis rather than signing onto long-term commitments. To name a few, brands like Pepsi, Mondelez, Georgia-Pacific, Frito-Lay, Best Buy, Chobani and Kimberly-Clark are adopting this approach. Dan’s advice: “Agencies should seize on the trend among big marketers to break up their advertising assignments among several shops brand by brand rather than rely on just one agency.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bw00oW2A0000405B0DnLPqA> Read on. 

Power Users 

According to data from comScore, only 8% of smartphone and tablet users get daily news via apps, but those who do use apps account for 45% of total mobile news viewership. Ken Doctor of NiemanLabs reports on how this is influencing digital publishing. Dow Jones CIO Edward Roussel says, “There’s an intimacy with an app. It’s on your phone and you’ve got limited space, and so it’s an honor to be an app on someone’s phone – because they’ve made space for you in the device that’s most personal to them.” Other publishers cite surprising internal numbers on app users.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0wqW0D00pAoB054PA> More.

Blank Canvas 

Horizon Media and Innocean Worldwide over the weekend launched an agency (or “media agency network”) called Canvas Worldwide, which beginning Jan. 1 will get in the driver’s seat of the Hyundai Motor Group’s $700 million US account. Horizon CEO Bill Koenigsberg alluded to the spate of agency reviews as a key driver for this development. "The $26 billion that's up for review now in the market – I believe that's pointing to the fact that the old models are broken,” he said. “Marketers are looking for a clean slate, new opportunity for invention, new creativity.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0gL00000P02BAqDw0k40A> More via Ad Age.

The WSJ’s Shalini Ramachandran reports that short-form video creators for the service will keep 70% of ad revenue they generate (compared to the 50-55% secured by the established social media channels). Comcast isn’t playing coy either, especially given its recent seven-figure investments in BuzzFeed and Vox. The broadcaster wants a seat at the digital table, and is clearly willing to pay for it. (As an aside, Verizon also has a streaming entertainment service in the pipeline.)  <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000h2040qAwLPDB0l0WA0> Read on. 

Road Ahead For The Gray Lady 

The New York Times’ public editor, Margaret Sullivan, checked in with CEO Mark Thompson about how to combat the decline of the publication’s print ad biz. Nudging digital revenue past print revenue is an attainable goal within five years, according to Thompson. For context, print advertising and subscriptions make up more than 70% of the Times’ revenue. Boosting mobile advertising is another priority, as is ramping up its sponsored content division, T Brand Studio. “We need to grow at a rate where digital overwhelms the inevitable secular decline on the print side,” Thompson said. Encouragingly, digital ad revenue and digital subscriptions grew by 14% last year.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0w000qim> Read it. 

Testing, Testing 

Speaking to The Drum, Millward Brown’s head of marketing in the UK, Amanda Phillips, makes a case for ditching clicks in favor of measuring consumer experience. One way Millward Brown is gunning for that is by pre-testing campaigns for its clients. “Rather than campaign effectiveness being decided on how many clicks they’ve got, I’d like to think we could come up with a predicted customer experience score,” Phillips said. “If programmatic is going to really work, then advertisers need to have variety in their ads but against a core platform of a creative idea.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0nj02q0L0AB0Dw00A04> More. 

Under The Bridge 

Adweek’s Lauren Johnson identifies a roster of influential publishers (Condé Nast, The Wall Street Journal, CNN and Fox News) that have brought on Livefyre, which lets sites embed sponsored posts into its comment section. The practice opens an expanse of untapped real estate for publishers and advertisers, but brand safety could be a concern. Big brands may not be comfortable pushing marketing content alongside commenters, territory that is often associated with trolls and online abuse.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pwk00q2o00> Read more.

News Round Up

So Watchable 

Sources tell Business Insider that Comcast plans to launch a video platform in the coming weeks. The platform is called Watchable for now, and will host content from digital publishers like Vox, BuzzFeed, AwesomenessTV, The Onion, Mic, Vice and NBC Sports. The platform would add to Comcast’s smart-TV solution, Xfinity. “Comcast is currently the largest seller of video ads in the United States," said one anonymous source. "As platforms shift to digital, Comcast doesn't want to lose market share, but they're losing it to YouTube and Facebook." The video platform space is getting crowded.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00UA0L0DQ00vB2qW0AFP04> Read more. 

Tech To The Rescue 

For a publisher like The New York Times, picking which of its 300 or so daily articles to promote on social media is a big job. To solve that problem, NYT built a bot called Blossom that works within messaging app Slack. Blossom processes story content data and measures it against performance metrics like Facebook’s post engagement tool. According to the Times’ chief data scientist, Chris Wiggins, Blossom is as much about helping editors as it is about promoting content. “When you are a technologist working at a company as big as The New York Times,” he said, “you can go into a room of twenty growth editors and ask them what parts of the day are difficult and how technology can help.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/FvDBL00RG0W0P2Uq000AA04> Nieman Journalism Lab has more. 

Betting On Buyable Pins 

Speaking to TechCrunch, Pinterest monetization GM Tim Kendall opens up about the social scrapbooking firm’s commerce plans. According to Kendall, Pinterest is betting on its Buyable Pins, which launched in June. “It is tempting to draw a buy button on a product and say you’ve enabled commerce,” he said. But that’s not enough. “In our case we feel like we’ve built the full end-to-end capability. We now offer 2.5 million products that are buyable.” Pinterest’s market cap hit $11 billion in May, after a round of funding led by Rakuten.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0vH0B4L0S2AAP00q0DU00> Read on. 

The Blame Game 

In a think piece published late last week, Fortune senior writer Mathew Ingram places the blame for ad blocker usage squarely on publishers’ shoulders. Ingram does cut publishers some slack by recognizing a core conundrum: Publishers rely on ads for revenue, “But in order to cater to advertisers who want to see large numbers, many feel they have to pump out as much shallow clickbait as they possibly can,” Ingram writes. “That in turn makes their sites even more reliant on advertising, because no one in their right mind would actually pay to subscribe to a site that publishes that kind of content.” Are publishers’ hands tied?  <http://go.adexchanger.com/GvB0AU20DI4TW0AL0000P0q> More.

News Round Up

Upwardly Mobile 

Global mobile ad revenues hit $31.9 billion in 2014, according to the IAB, IAB Europe and IHS. And mobile display hit an all-time high of $15.1 billion (overtaking search for the first time). “These numbers have been underpinned by the industry coming together to collaborate and create improvements to mobile advertising infrastructure,” said Daniel Knapp, IHS’ director of advertising research. “Technology is now better explained, measurement is improving and targeting is better aligned with other media to help advertisers reach and engage with their audiences.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/gm0D40L0q20vBA0AW0006PP> Read the release. 

Snapchat Discover Uncovered 

Snapchat’s content hub Discover has averaged 2.5 sponsored posts per day since July 13, according to Ad Age. These ads ran against 110 editorial articles, videos or images. (Recall that Discover features 12 channels from publishers like National Geographic, Vice and Cosmo.) Basically, that’s a ratio of one ad per 44 stories. "The first thing we were going for was the audience and the chance to curate and craft and edit stories in a new and interesting way for that audience on that platform," said Meredith Artley, editor-in-chief of CNN Digital. "Then we'll get the revenue later." If boosting ad sales wasn’t a top priority before, it might be one soon.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0v70B4L0n2AAP00q0DP00> Read it. 

Inside Israel’s Tech Boom 

Business Insider reporter Julie Bort takes a close look at the startup scene in Israel and its biggest players. Israel’s tech boom isn’t breaking news, but growing investment from Chinese investors is a recent development. China is the biggest spender in the Israeli market, with investments flooding in from companies like Baidu, Fosun, Alibaba, Tencent, RenRen and others. And Chinese angel investor Li Ka Shing (who owns Horizon Ventures) has also donated $130 million to Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology. “The Asia stuff is very dramatic, very real and very new," said Israeli VC Jon Medved. As a refresher, billion-dollar Israeli startups include Taboola, IronSource, Outbrain and Conduit.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/uo0000DB4L0A0802PPqWAv0> More. 

The Omnichannel Publisher Approach 

Publishers are working hard to fit apps into their business strategies, the WSJ reports, but are facing extreme competition. The Journal’s Mike Shields details the efforts of Rodale, publisher of Runner’s World magazine. Rodale had released apps before focused on specific promotional campaigns, but last week it debuted its first fitness tracker. All very cool – but moving from a one-off app to something with long-term utility means having to step into the ring with the likes of Fitbit, Nike, Apple and MapMyFitness. Talk about a spike in heart rate. Can a media company compete?  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4P090P00qD002LBW0pAv> More. 

M Is For Moonshot 

Alphabet’s emergence shocked the industry, but reasons behind the switch are coming into focus. According to Google (now a subsidiary of Alphabet), the change was partially about retaining executives and facilitating investment in new fields without affecting its core business. Outside its core ads biz,  <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLPWq0APva020qD40> Re/code reports on the “L” in the alphabet, Life Sciences, a health research group that now has a cell biologist as its CEO.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0rP0Lv0DB0b0W0q4P20A0A> Another Re/code story suggests Google may end up keeping Linus Upson, the engineering VP who built Chrome (alongside Google CEO Sundar Pichai), by investing in a new malaria treatment involving genetically-modified mosquitoes. Google says, “Don’t be evil.” Maybe, in some aspects, it’ll stand for good?

News Round Up

On-Site Shopping 

Want to promote a product on Amazon.com that sells on a different ecommerce site? By Oct. 31 you’ll be out of luck, because Amazon is going to end that offering, aka its “Product Ads.” The Wall Street Journal speculates the move is a  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW09L0000KP02BAqDv0u40A> challenge to Google, which got information about Amazon users through those ads. But whatever Amazon’s reasons (and the retail giant, as usual, is staying mum), its decision to end Product Ads in favor of something called Text Ads is raising eyebrows, since Product Ads are pretty popular. Despite brand and retailer pushback, powerhouse digital platforms continue to find value in closing off their networks.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0vqW0D00aAvB0K4PA> Read more at Ad Age. 

The Power And Problems Of Autoplay 

Facebook’s foray into autoplay video has generally been a success, said Ben Winkler, US chief digital officer of ad agency OMD. But the social media giant still needs to figure out how to combine video with its existing targeting capabilities. Also, advertisers can’t control the context in which their video ads show up. “One bad content adjacency can scuttle an entire campaign,” Winkler said. With no tools in place to manage placement context, crisis management could continue to plague Facebook video advertisers.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPvw0Kq0AD00B4b020W0> More via Beet.TV. 

Podcast Upfronts Cont. 

The IAB is planning a podcast upfront this fall, a first for the IAB, though not for the medium, the WSJ reports. In April, NPR, WBEZ and WNYC banded together to host a podcast upfront in an attempt to drum up advertiser interest, and with its upfront, the IAB is bringing podcast networks like Midroll into the fold. “Our aim is to test the market,” said Carl Kalapesi, VP of industry initiatives at IAB. “What we are really trying to do is educate and showcase great podcasts for marketers. A lot of folks in this industry have interest but haven’t taken the next step.” EMarketer predicts that ad spending on digital radio (which includes platforms like Spotify and podcasts) will grow 27.9% this year to hit $2.75 billion.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWx400c0ABD00K0vL02P0Aq> More. 

Pestilential Pirates 

The Drum reports on results from a two-year campaign by the city of London’s Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) against ad-funded pirate websites. Illegal sites that provide content like TV, games and movies are funded by legitimate ads – sometimes tricking marketers into believe they’re buying premium ad spots. According to PIPCU, pirated content has dipped 73% as a result of the campaign. The $350 million at stake is a tiny fraction of what ad fraud brings in, but many security experts say plugging the easy leaks is a necessary precondition to comprehensive repair.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPvy0Kq0AD00B4d020W0> Read on. 

Built For Speed 

Facebook and Apple claim they’re developing products like the former’s Instant Articles and the latter’s News app to provide faster load times for publishers. But those publishers aren’t exactly sitting on their rears waiting for others to build a better mousetrap. A spate of recent redesigns have focused on faster load times. Digiday covers GQ’s new site, which had been weighed down by redundant server calls and third-party tags and was publishing on multiple content management systems. For its efforts, GQ is seeing its return in the form of higher engagement rates and inventory value.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bv00eW2A000040KB0DzLPqA> More. 

Honey From The Bees 

Gawker has obtained an internal document detailing BuzzFeed’s finances from the past few years, something Andreessen Horowitz and NBCUniversal considered before investing in the media company. Considering its $1.5 billion valuation, BuzzFeed’s profits are fairly ho-hum – losses in the low millions switching to profits in the low millions in 2013. But the company’s revenue has been tripling every year, matched by investments in editorial. BuzzFeed’s multiples don’t compare to public media analogues like The New York Times, but upstart digital pubs are steadily gaining advertiser investments.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPvA4B00W000qAK0020AfD> More here. 

New Toys For Developers 

Mobile ad firm Opera Mediaworks expanded its offerings on Wednesday with the addition of a marketing automation platform designed to boost monetization for developers and drive user retention. The platform will integrate with Opera Mediaworks and AdColony SDKs, and offers developers analytics, A/B testing, advanced player segmentation and messaging tools to serve users digital and physical rewards in real time. According to Opera Mediaworks CMO Will Kassoy, the upgrade is about balancing new ways to drive user engagement while safeguarding user experience. The platform will go live this fall and will be more widely available to select partners by Q4 2015.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0BKvWPg0A00> Read the release. 

MaxPoint Hurt By Advertiser Fickleness 

MaxPoint, which helps drive in-store sales via geotargeting tech, posted ex-TAC revenue of $21.3 million in Q2, a YoY increase of 40%. Margins were 51.7%, in part due to softer pricing on the exchanges. Investors were concerned about Q2 underperformance, as some of MaxPoint’s 801 advertisers cancelled budgets or delayed spend toward the end of the quarter. CEO Joe Epperson said it wasn’t related to agency reviews, but rather advertisers’ shifting budgets and cancelled promotions. Unreliability: another knock on ad tech’s rep in the investor community.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000K2Cv0L0B0hA4PDAq> Read the release.

News Round Up

Don’t Feed The Trolls 

The proliferation of apps and tech like QR codes has opened up the marketing world to millions in legal fees from patent trolls. It’s often cheaper paying a settlement than trying to win in court. Ad Age reports that the ANA has heard its members’ protests, and is working with Scottsdale Insurance Co. to absorb some of those costs. Settlement fees aren’t covered, but it gives agencies and tech companies a way to do battle in court without prohibitive costs. The insurer will make the service available only to ANA members.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/lGBqr000LvDP0A2A4000Q0W> Read on. 

Tech Buyout 

Private equity firm Carlyle Group bought Veritas from Symantec for $8 billion. Veritas, a data storage and server management company, gets Bill Coleman as its chief executive. (Coleman is the founder and former CEO of Oracle-owned BEA Systems.) The deal marks the largest tech buyout so far this year. The equity-to-debt ratio was not disclosed, but a cohort of banks (including BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, CUBS and Jefferies) will provide debt financing. Veritas pulled in $2.5 billion in revenue last year.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LGR2sADP0v00A0> Fortune has more. The private equity  <http://go.adexchanger.com/GvB0AG20Dt4SW0AL0000P0q> investment escalation in advertising and technology continues. 

What’s Fresh At The Market 

Twitter’s MoPub released its quarterly MarketPlace Report on Tuesday. The report surfaces some signs of a maturing digital ecosystem. First, it highlights how direct client relationships have helped “publishers and demand partners maximize the benefits of programmatic through Private Marketplaces.” It also shows how common it has become for pubs to produce new ad formats. Overall, the shift to programmatic appears to open up new methods for collaboration and creativity.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00TWqA000vPGA0u040D2L> More. 

Konnichiwa Q1 

Japanese holding company The Dentsu Group increased its Q1 2015 revenue by 14.9% YoY to ¥150 billion (about $1.2 billion). For those without a scorecard, Dentsu Group has a Japanese operation called Dentsu Inc. and an international business (which houses agencies like Carat, 360i and Isobar) called Dentsu Aegis Network. Dentsu Group’s Q1 coincides with Dentsu Aegis Network’s Q2, due to a super convoluted financial calendar situation. So with that in mind, Dentsu Aegis Network’s Q2 organic gross profit growth was 10.2%; it was 11.8% for the first half of 2015. Much of that growth came from EMEA (16.1% organic gross profit growth in Q2), driven by strong performance across all European countries, though Russia is still a little uncertain. As a whole, Dentsu Aegis Network saw $1.4 billion in net new business billings during the first half of 2015.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0Uv02q0L0AB0Dv00AG4> Read the press release. 

Realpolitik 

Wanna win an election? Google (and search engine algorithms in general) has enormous power to elevate candidates.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/qvAW0A0DLw004G02B0PV00q> A recent study says a search engine’s ranking of positive or negative news can significantly impact voter opinions, and elections in Australia and India revealed that, beyond a focus group, search engines have as much as a 3-4% swing in major elections. Considering the US presidency is won in a handful of purple states with razor-thin margins, that 3-4% can make Google an unmatched political player.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PxDGA40LvB00WA> More at Wired.

News Round Up

A Whole New Google 

Google unveiled a major overhaul of its operating structure late Monday. Under the new plan, Google and its multiple divisions are now subsidiaries of a company called Alphabet, with Larry Page at the helm. Google gets Sundar Pichai as CEO in the reshuffle. “We are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products,” Page wrote in a blog post. “The whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.” Page defines Alphabet as a collection of companies, adding that the “newer Google is a bit slimmed down,” as some of its Internet products get transferred to Alphabet (products like Life Sciences and Calico). Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/TK0WA0P0v000DBf20L4qAA0> . 

Algorithm Issues 

Algorithms are increasingly key in the decisioning for targeted ads, but there’s a dark side to that, the NYT reports. Biases in code can lead to digital discrimination, such as serving ads for high-interest loans to low-income demographics. In another recent debacle, research showed algorithms served ads for high-paying jobs to men but not to women. Is faulty code to blame? “Here is a different plausible explanation,” proposes Cynthia Dwork, a computer scientist at Microsoft Researcher. “It may be that there is more competition to advertise to women, and the ad was being outbid when the web surfer was female.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PvL00q2g0A> . 

Touchdown for Twitter! 

The National Football League (NFL) renewed a strategic deal with Twitter for two more years following an original Twitter Amplify alliance, which began in 2013. Expect more football clips in your news feeds, since Twitter will syndicate in-game highlights throughout the preseason leading up to Super Bowl 50. The NFL also touts improved delivery of video, sponsored ads and brand integrations as a result of the extension. Variety has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LAh2MADP0v00A0> . In related news, after interim CEO Jack Dorsey purchased 31,627 shares of the stumbling company, its stock shot up nearly 7%, according to Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40i0A2A0BNLD0WvP00q0A0> . 

Facebook Throws Developers A Bone 

On Monday, Facebook released a reference app for its marketing API that offers sample interfaces and code for ads creation, ads management and ads insights. “We've heard from the developer community over the years about the challenges getting started with our Marketing API,” said the company in a blog post. “It can be difficult to envision a final product when only looking at reference docs, authentication can be confusing, and too much time and energy is spent on building foundational technology rather than product innovation.” Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqOB0v2LW004D0P0AAj0A00> . 

One App To Rule Them All 

Connie Chan, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, published a blog post on the products and prospects of Chinese messaging firm WeChat. The company offers a system of apps within apps (like web pages on the Internet), overlapping with operating systems and app stores. WeChat’s Wallet (one of its native apps), is also a payment portal. (Don’t forget: Facebook hired a former PayPal CEO to lead its competitive messaging service.) In the age of social behemoths, messaging platforms are gaining ground. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/iPAW00BvPkL00A000Dq2A04> . 

Foursquare’s Breakup Anniversary 

One year after Foursquare split into two apps (Swarm for checking in and Foursquare for recommendations), VentureBeat checks in with company chief Dennis Crowley about the firm’s ads biz. “We’re licensing our data out to the Twitters, the Microsofts, and the Pinterests, and the 80K other developers, and we’re doing it with this entire ad tech stack,” he said. Foursquare’s product Pinpoint, for instance, displays ads on and off Foursquare’s app, including in other apps and on other sites. “It’s helping to take advertising that’s slightly targeted and turning it into richly targeted media,” said Crowley. But Foursquare will have to prove its worth if it means to conquer Yelp’s turf. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0AWD0LQ000B4000vl> . 

Flowing From Channel To Stream 

FX Networks President John Landgraf said that the next year will see the zenith of American TV programming, before going into a decline. Speaking to the Television Critics Association, Landgraf predicted the current glut of programming (with more than 400 scripted programs this year, not to mention an endless archive on Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime) will dampen the prospects for new shows. But he doesn’t think advertising will suffer, as “brands will become increasingly important as mediating filters for the overwhelmed viewing public.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0vAAR0DmA00> .

News Round Up

Firefox’s Ad Hack 

Late last week, a Firefox exploit was discovered running through a corrupt ad on a news site in Russia. The malvert scanned sensitive files in search of developer codes and site configuration files and was tied to Firefox’s PDF viewer. Mozilla products that don’t support a PDF viewer, like Firefox for Android, were not vulnerable. Although the bug couldn’t execute code, it injected JavaScript into local files, which allowed it to search and upload those files. Users with ad blocking software may have been spared, according to Mozilla, depending on their filter settings. The firm released security updates to patch the hack and recommends users upgrade to the latest version of Firefox. More via Mozilla Security blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0vqW0D00mAWB0v4PA> . 

There’s No ‘I’ In C-3PO 

In an interview with CMO, Adobe’s marketing chief, Ann Lewnes, debunks the idea that automation leads to fewer hands on deck. “Data is not so automated now that everything is triggered and just robots are doing marketing,” she said, “You still need judgement.” Because of this, Lewnes said Adobe has insourced a lot of resources, particularly in the area of creative. “If you are a data-driven marketer with a website, and you’re testing constantly whether the content is working, you need someone right there to rewrite it,” she said. “If you have a display ad that’s not working, you need someone right there to redo it.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pvn00q2X0v> . 

Radio RTB?   

Speaking to eMarketer, Marketron CEO Jeff Haley says programmatic is coming to terrestrial radio – but not immediately. Marketron provides software to radio broadcasters, and is working with SSPs to lay the pipelines for programmatic trading for terrestrial. But according to Haley, it’s still early for RTB. “The potential for RTB in the radio space is only inasmuch as there’s enough velocity to manage it,” he said. “By this time next year there will be multiple broadcasters trading inventory programmatically on a spot basis.” iHeartMedia executed one programmatic test buy that got an ad on the air within 15 minutes. Steady as she goes. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/qvAW0A0DLo004v02B0PY00q> . 

Goliath Abides 

A tough news cycle for ESPN notwithstanding, flagship sports programming is soaring above the rest of broadcast television. On the CBS earnings call last week, CEO Les Moonves said the company is already selling 30-second spots for next year’s Super Bowl for $5 million – an 11% jump from last year, according to Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000p2040qAvLPDBvZ0WA0>  – plus additional digital revenue. Meanwhile, The WSJ reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0P040w0DrAvq2>  that NBC sales leaders are optimistic about the potential ad haul for next year’s Rio de Janeiro Olympics, with a better time zone for US audiences and little commercial skipping. Supposedly the company is demanding an advertiser spend more than $15 million before gaining access to premium digital and OTT inventory. 

Cool Your Jets 

Jet.com, a recently launched online membership store (think digital Costco), is butting heads with some of the nation’s biggest retailers, The WSJ reports. Jet had been linking out to unaffiliated online sites and giving member points and cash back on purchases made off its domain. Retailers like Walmart, Gap, Williams Sonoma, Home Depot and Macy’s have demanded Jet cease the practice (until they formalize a deal). Some retailers are perfectly happy to take Jet’s traffic and sales, but others view it as unwelcome competition. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0wWD0Ls000B4000v1> .

News Round Up

The Black Market 

Media companies have taken an absolute shellacking in the past 48 hours as a series of poor earnings reports – as well as a drumbeat of news about the unbundling of broadcast properties – has soured investors on some longtime favorite stocks. “Media stocks are getting slaughtered,” one major portfolio manager told The WSJ. Among the victims: Viacom, Time Warner, Disney, 21st Century Fox, Discovery, Dish Network and more. What’s driving the freak-out? Fear of those pesky cord-cutters. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02E000Yp00vPW04DABAqL0> . 

The Honeypot 

Will it soon be tax time for ad tech? It will if four states (CA, NC, IL and PA) get their way. Each is preparing to introduce sales tax on services (health care, education and small businesses exempted). And ad tech falls into that taxable category. Naturally, any company with a stake in advertising is way down on this prospect. Opponents note how a 1980s law signed in Florida led major lobbying and a boycott from major advertisers. On the other hand, a report out of DC said that “$169 billion could be raised over 10 years if businesses were required to deduct advertising expenses over five years.” Read more at Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0pWD0LZ000B4000vF> . 

Spot On Or Move On 

If X doesn’t mark the spot, brands won’t be keen on using location data. Although eight in 10 marketers around the world said they use location targeting for mobile advertising, ad company xAd found that deficiencies in measurement, campaign performance and accuracy keep purse strings kind of taut. But the purse is opening nonetheless. According to BIA/Kelsey, location-targeted ad spend is expected to rise 56% this year.

Brick and Mortar (and Hardware) 

Target is embarking on a nationwide beacon roll-out, beginning with 50 stores in major markets with plans to expand later in the year. TechCrunch reports that the beacon network will allow the retailer to do things like send targeted coupons or share Target’s top-pinned products on Pinterest. The notifications are limited to visitors that use Target’s app and have opted in to the program. These user interface hurdles are commonly cited limitations with beacon tech. Target will also limit the notifications to two per trip to avoid annoying customers. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0HvA001pD0AP00040> . 

TV Advances 

According to Q2 research from ad software firm Videology, advertisers are using more TV audience data to target commercials and launch multiplatform campaigns. In fact, the number of video campaigns that rely on targeted audience data is up 91% over 2015’s first quarter, according to the report. Videology chief Scott Ferber adds that cross-screen planning and buying are on the rise. “With so much cross-screen data now at advertisers' fingertips, the planning siloes between TV and digital video campaigns are truly coming down," he said. Broadcasting  <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP0020IL0pW00AD2q0vA04> & Cable has more. 

Programmatic EU 

More than 90% of European ad execs plan to grow their investment in programmatic, according to research from IAB Europe, though a lack of expertise remains a hurdle. IAB Europe polled 1,000 execs from the buy- and sell-sides, who cited improved targeting, increased operational efficiencies and competitive advantage as big draws for programmatic. Agency execs were quick to peg themselves as early adopters of ad tech, and 77% said they’re investing as much as 40% of their digital ad spend programmatically. In some cases, that means taking automation into their own hands. Four in ten agency execs revealed that the majority of their programmatic investment is happening in-house. More via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLpWJ0APv3020qD40> . 

MDC Rebuilds 

MDC Partners reported Q2 revenues of $336.6 million, up 12.4% YoY. Organic revenue increased 8.3% during the quarter, ahead of IPG (6.7%), Omnicom (5.3%) and Publicis (1.4%). This was MDC Partners CEO Scott Kauffman’s first earnings call with investors, and he apologized for the to-do (or to-don’t) over former CEO Miles Nadal’s misuse of company funds. As for pitchapalooza, Kauffman said MDC is more immune to media reviews as it lacks the scale of competing holding companies.

News Round Up

Ads, Exploited 

A malvertising attack on Yahoo has resurfaced the debate on ad network security. Though Yahoo says initial reports were “grossly misrepresented,” the attack proves how simple it is for fraudsters to game the system. In this case, a security flaw in Flash let malicious software run on a visitor’s computer, providing fake page views that were sold on an open exchange. Ad Age interviewed Jerome Segura, the Malwarebytes security researcher who uncovered the breach, who says that the speed and real-time nature of malware attacks mean the industry needs to move past “patching” and into preemptive anti-virus software.

Bright Horizons 

Speaking to Beet.TV, Arun Kumar, global president of IPG’s trading desk Cadreon, spelled out IPG’s position and seemed to take a jab at a certain WPP-owned trading desk. As a group, “We do not buy inventory, and we do not resell it,” Kumar said. “We are not media companies that are sitting within an agency holding group.” Shifting the conversation to advanced TV, Kumar said that once unlocked, addressable TV will be hard to beat. “If I were a pure digital player, I would look at this as a threat,” he said. “If TV stations are able to bring in the level of targeting that traditionally Google and Facebook offer, can you imagine the possibilities for them and how much spend they can unlock?” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0vAAX0DHl00> . 

Fa$tly 

Fastly unveiled a $75 million round of funding led by Iconiq Capital, bringing its total funding to $130 million. Fastly bills itself as a real-time content delivery network (CDN) and works with clients like Business Insider, Conde Nast, iHeartMedia, Twitter and Vimeo. According to CEO Artur Bergman, “The lack of innovation by traditional CDNs has frustrated many of our customers by holding back their ability to create faster, secure and highly personalized user experiences."

Whatsup? 

Facebook added chat features for businesses on Wednesday that let them communicate directly with users through ads. The messaging capabilities are tailored to local awareness campaigns, and a business on the receiving end of a message can see which ads sparked a conversation. “Messaging has become a preferred communication channel for people, and now people and businesses on Facebook can start real-time conversations with each other in more ways,” Facebook wrote in a blog post.

News Round Up

Dont Call It A Comeback 

After nearly a decade, it’s official: Do Not Track (DNT) is supported by all major browsers. But just because DNT exists across browsers doesn’t mean it’s being honored. As such, the EFF, Disconnect and several other organizations are working to publish a new DNT standard. “The failure of the ad industry and privacy groups to reach a compromise on DNT has led to a viral surge in ad blocking, massive losses for Internet companies dependent on ad revenue, and increasingly malicious methods of tracking users and surfacing advertisements online,” said Disconnect CEO Casey Oppenheim. With the new approach, the coalition hopes to pave a path “that allows privacy and advertising to coexist,” he added. Threatpost has the story. 

Big Media Meets Big Data 

Advance/Newhouse snapped up big-data firm 1010data for $500 million. Advance/Newhouse is an affiliate of Advance Publications, the media group that runs Bright House Networks and Condé Nast. 1010data offers a cloud-based analytics platform that crunches big data, and Bright House President Nomi Bergman is joining the firm’s board. Speaking to the WSJ, Bergman explained that 1010data offers “a quick ramp up for companies [onto a big data platform]. ... My experience in the cable industry is that it takes years for companies to get up and running.” But for now it’s unclear how Advance/Newhouse will apply the data it’s buying. Read more. 

Playing Politics 

With the first political debate among presidential hopefuls coming this Thursday, The NYT dives into the Rand Paul campaign’s digital media nerve center to get a sense of how political spenders are approaching social media. Twitter, for instance, is allowing campaigns to embed code on the candidate’s site(s) and then promote tweets to those visitors on Twitter. Google/YouTube’s election team is prepping for the keywords and trends that will be valuable to political advertisers. For instance, who will get to own ad rights for the search, “who won the debate?” or “best debate line?” Read on. 

A Little (Blue) Birdy Told Me 

Twitter’s stock price has plummeted in the wake of an executive transition and a period of unsteady growth. Bloomberg reports that Twitter’s slump is setting up a near-perfect acquisition scenario. Google has long been considered a potential Twitter buyer, and Twitter has recently integrated more deeply with Google on display initiatives and receives significant internal search traffic. Some portfolio managers think a Google or Facebook acquisition makes so much sense that they’re holding Twitter’s stock with that presumed outcome in mind. Read more. 

On The Air 

Interactive audio ad firm XAPPmedia released its Q2 Internet Radio Ad Load Report, which found that Internet radio ad load is 22% that of terrestrial radio. According to XAPPmedia CEO Pat Higbie, this is about audience competition. “Internet radio publishers cannot run higher ad loads than competitors and risk inhibiting audience growth, and terrestrial broadcasters can’t take the economic hit of reducing their ad loads,” Higbie told AdExchanger. For ad loads to increase on Internet radio, consolidation would be key. “That is likely to take years given the number of players in the market.” Get the report. 

Imgur Courts Advertisers 

Advertisers are doing a double take on Imgur, Adweek reports. The photo, GIF and meme aggregation site will soon widely release a promoted post product. The secret to successful advertising on Imgur could be akin to Reddit: Do not ruffle the community’s feathers. "We worked with Imgur for several months to research the types of themes and items that were popular on site, and we worked with some Imgurians to source imagery that helped us tell the best stories," said Johnna Hoff, eBay's head of communications. Imgur hosts 150 million monthly active users.  Read it.

News Round Up

Yahoo Aims High With Gemini 

The Journal’s Mike Shields reports that Yahoo’s proprietary ad-buying platform, Yahoo Gemini, is starting to turn heads. Yahoo has been beefing up its targeting capabilities since debuting Gemini in February and hopes its focus on mobile will help its solution standout. Cadreon Global President Arun Kumar, for one, thinks Gemini is promising. “I think this is Yahoo’s big play,” he said. “It’s picking up quite well in the market.” The challenge for Yahoo now will be to build awareness among big marketers and agencies and integrate the offering fully into BrightRoll, the digital video ad tech firm Yahoo snapped up in November.

Instagram Unwraps API   

Facebook-owned Instagram has named 11 marketing partners to a new ads API, which recently went live. Those partners are 4C, Brand Networks, Ampush, Kenshoo, Laundry Service, Publicis-owned agency MediaVest, Nanigans, Olapic, Resolution Media, Salesforce, SocialCode, Social Moov and Unified. The news comes as Instagram embraces more of the data-driven ad approaches that have done so well on Facebook proper. Instagram made no comment on the new program, but back in June it said in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBH000Abv0A200WL4qPB00> , "Working with Facebook, we will enable advertisers to reach people on Instagram based on demographics and interests, as well as information businesses have about their own customers." 

(Home) Page One 

Twitter looked different to certain users in the US on Monday, as the company began experimenting with a “news tab.” A Twitter spokesperson confirmed the trial phase in a statement to BuzzFeed, hailing it as an exercise in exploring new ways to surface content to users. BuzzFeed reporter Alex Kantrowitz writes, “Though no ads currently accompany this experiment, Twitter’s News tab could have significant revenue implications for the company if it’s implemented as a core platform feature.” Can Twitter monetize the wires?

A GIFt To Marketers 

Messenger apps and keyboard extensions are giving rise to more visual, less text-based dialogue.  The NYT profiles some of the emoji companies behind these add-ons, including Riffsy (which enables users to send GIFs via text) and Giphy (a library and search engine for GIFs). Both have raised money recently, but (surprise) neither has a meaningful revenue stream. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0vJ0B4L0D2AAP00q0Db00> . 

The Fault In Our Stars 

Writing for Medium, YouTube series star Hank Green alleges that Facebook’s meteoric rise as a video platform obscures a certain deceitfulness around analytics. This partly has to do with Facebook’s perspective on what makes a video viewable (three seconds of mute action). Green takes issue with Facebook’s habit of letting users rip videos from YouTube and removing them only once views are logged. Content creators have been howling over Facebook’s treatment for months, but Facebook has yet to respond. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0v0EWD0L4PK0A2q0b0BA00> . 

Another Ecommerce Challenger 

India-based ecommerce startup Snapdeal raised $500 million, Re/code reports. Alibaba is among a group of investors that also includes SoftBank, as the Chinese ecommerce giant looks to expand its global footing. The Indian ecommerce market is hot right now, mainly due to a rising population whose first point of contact with the Internet is increasingly mobile. As a result, mobile shopping in the region is booming. But time will tell if Snapdeal gives Alibaba the boost it’s looking for to steal global market share from Amazon.

News Round Up

Buying Niches

WPP teamed up with with US buyout firm Providence Equity Partners to acquire sports marketing firm Chime Communications for $584 million. ”WPP needs to build its position in the sports market and therefore this is a strategic asset," said Simon Davies, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Reuters has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/f004A0L0Dj00vB2qW0AiP04> . Related: Dentsu snapped up Synergy Medical Communications. A spokesperson tells AdExchanger, “The marketing of prescription drugs by pharmaceutical companies and other health care-related entities has reached a major turning point due to health care reforms and changing drug development trends.” Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPvk4B00W000qA40020AjD>  The future of agencies is vertical.

Automating The Audience

Seven in 10 US media execs expressed concerns about delivering audiences on digital, according to May data from Market Measurement. And they’re turning to tech to solve the problem. Among survey respondents asked which advertising technology is most essential, 41% said they’re focused on mobile, and a majority (52%) are likely to grow investments in programmatic. Ad tech to the rescue! More from eMarketer <http://go.adexchanger.com/GvB0A420Dk4lW0AL0000P0q> .

Keep Calm And Carry On

There have been a few data breaches of gigantic proportions – Target (40 million customers), JPMorgan Chase (80 million accounts), UCLA (4.5 million health records) – but The New York Times says those big numbers are misleading a public that’s already bitterly concerned over the security of its personal and consumer data. Security experts have caught up to hackers in sophistication, meaning losses from data breaches are going down, and even when there are breaches a slim fraction of those affected are actually put at risk. Read the full report <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPvm4B00W000qA40020AlD> .

Open Aggression

The open, programmatic exchange world is experiencing a shift from “adversaries” to “allies” as publishers and exchange companies push back against Silicon Valley giants Facebook and Google (which control a solid majority of the world’s online advertising). At least that’s what AppNexus President Michael Rubenstein foresees – though he’s clearly got a horse in the race. In Australia, AppNexus joined media companies to make a mobile inventory coalition, but to date that’s been a more international than domestic phenomenon.

Google For Liberté

Late last week, Google braced for a standoff with France after announcing it would fight efforts by the EU to apply Right to be Forgotten worldwide. A French privacy regulator, La Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), has given Google until the end of July to comply with its ruling. Google agreed to remove links from European domains, but refuses to apply the ruling outside Europe. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0v0oWD0L4Pn0A2q040BA00> , Google’s global privacy counsel Peter Fleischer, played the liberté card. “If the CNIL’s proposed approach were to be embraced as the standard for Internet regulation, we would find ourselves in a race to the bottom,” he wrote. The EU vs Silicon Valley saga continues. More via the NYT <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0v0pWD0L4Po0A2q040BA00> .
