 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Quizzing Ramaswamy

Ever since Google’s former ad boss, Susan Wojcicki, took the reins at YouTube, Sridhar Ramaswamy has been running the company’s sprawling ad strategy. He shares some thoughts on display, video and mobile in a truncated chat with Ad Age. Addressing native, he seems to acknowledge fragmentation of ad formats is the future. The question is: “What do we need to do to work with publishers to produce ad units that are very complementary to what they want to do on their app or site?" Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/G9B0Ag20DL4WW0AL0000P0q> .

Mobile Exchange Limits

A Medialets analysis finds programmatically traded mobile ads grew 500% from 2014's first quarter to its second quarter. But! Rob Hof writes for Forbes that ”ads run by exchanges and DSPs aren’t always the most effective. Click-through rates on ads placed directly by publishers and ad networks are 0.47% and 0.6% respectively, while DSP ads only get 0.3% and exchanges just 0.11%.” And Hof notes another problem: The study ignores native.

Twitchy Data

NYT’s data visualization team tackles Twitch, finding peak daily traffic on the future Amazon property rivals some cable networks during prime time. “But compared with online video giants, Twitch is small.” The charts reveal that Twitch users are adept at both building audiences and holding attention. For in-stream video boosters (and for Amazon), that’s good news. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/B900NW2A000040gB0DYLPqA> .

Cost-Plus Fuss  

Dated billing models the biggest threat to progress in the ad industry, according to Skip Brand, CEO of Branding Big Data, who writes for MediaBizBloggers that “The current time and materials or cost-plus model does not work well anymore. Costs and technology investments are much higher in the new high tech platform era of media buying and selling. The technology and platforms have changed with the times as we automate, but the brands and agency procurement offices have not.”  Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBO000Ag90A200WL4qPZ00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Weak Signal

Facebook now lets advertisers target mobile users in high-growth countries based on the strength of their network connection. “Targeting a video campaign to people with high-speed connections, and swapping in an image or link ad for people with slower connections, means ads can perform more efficiently.” Read the post <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqJB092LW004D0P0AA10900> . But, shouldn’t Facebook control this aspect of the user experience? At least one use case says no: Device makers can target 2G network device owners with upgrade offers.

Matomy Reports

Israel-based performance ad company Matomy Media Group reported interim results, including organic revenue growth of 25%. In the wake of July’s IPO <http://go.adexchanger.com/y99WDqP00A0LAB204K00020> , CEO Ofer Druker said, "We have [been] ... improving our programmatic media-buying capabilities and business intelligence infrastructure, launching our pay-per-call activity and strategically acquiring a controlling stake in [Munich-based search company] Team Internet." Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P09LA0000q0D320LAW9> .

Onboarding To Video

Video firm Eyeview and Acxiom-owned data onboarder LiveRamp have partnered to connect digital interactions with in-store purchases. Eyeview will use LiveRamp's tech to let clients onboard their CRM data for targeted online video ads. "CRM data, especially offline data related to in-store sales, is often underutilized in advertising," said Gabi Peles, SVP of client services at Eyeview. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/B900MW2A0000409B0D4LPqA> .

Beacon + Ads

Where you are influences what you buy. At least, that’s what location-based mobile ad company Verve and beacon provider Gimbal are betting on with their partnership <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W09NA0q050BAL0PD92> . The two companies claim to be able to track in-store customer interactions through beacon technology and use that information to drive better foot traffic and mobile advertising ROI. Several customers are reportedly testing the new offering. Speaking of beacons, in late July it came to light that certain Lord & Taylor and Hudson’s Bay stores would be using them to identify consumers and send location-based messages to shoppers who had downloaded certain apps.

Push To Open

Mobile tech company Urban Airship rolled out interactive push notifications <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00POD9A40L9B006A> . Now, rather than ostensibly ignoring push, users will be able to interact directly with without having to actually launch the app. Urban Airship is looking to the upcoming iOS 8 launch to jumpstart adoption. Why would an advertiser care? They could send users directly to product pages to make a purchase.

*	Data-Driven Thinking Column… Not Taking Programmatic In-House Is Short-Sighted <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB2000A390A200WL4qPq00>  "The simplest way to describe taking programmatic ad tech in house is to say that in the future, most advertisers will run their own in-house trading desk or put it on the consideration table. Those that go in-house have the potential to reap extra advantages and gain a market edge by virtue of owning a new competency and absorbing it into their DNA..."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

WPP Media Revs

WPP Group’s revenues rose 2.7% to reach $9 billion in the second quarter as the holding company acquired research firm InsightExpress. Read the earnings release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D9BqA0020P0WzA3b00>  In an investor note, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser notes WPP’s gross revenues this year are inflated “because of the inclusion of media inventory it takes possession of before selling along to advertisers. Including this activity, like-for-like revenues were up by 10.2%. The figure clearly is unrepresentative of WPP’s actual performance.” Hm. Are we talking about an agency or an ad platform?

Bringing Back The Banner

Banner ads and home page takeovers may seem dated in the native era, but Gannett Co. doesn't see it that way. Commenting on its new display formats, VP of Revenue Solutions Steve Ahlberg tells the WSJ, "We are really trying to push the idea of premium. We think this will create a natural extension from TV to online. Instead of video ads in little boxes we want to make the entire screen a TV set.” Gannett's willing to gamble viewers would rather be hyperaware they're seeing an ad, rather than deceived by sponsored content.

Rubicon’s Long Game

Rubicon Project CEO Frank Addante talks of grit, determination and petabytes in an interview with Forbes’ Bruce Rogers. “Seven years ago, I felt like I was pushing a boulder up a hill, and now the largest agencies in the world that are talking about automation." There’s some fun Rubicon trivia here, including the fact that the company created a “RubiCube” data center and programs its own chips. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D9BqA0020P0WBA3d00> .

Partnering For Programmatic TV

Turn is bolstering its programmatic offerings through a partnership with TV ad-buying platform AdMore, the companies said Monday. Turn, a DSP with DMP baked in, first delved into automation several months ago. Speaking to MediaPost, AdMore CEO Brendan Condon commented, "Programmatic TV can only be considered possible when you can dynamically insert an ad campaign into linear programming content – which is not available today but definitely on the horizon for the industry.” It's only a matter of time before the digital takeover.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook ID

Facebook is understood to be building a cross-device user ID solution that would be baked into its rebuilt Atlas ad server and provide a replacement for the beleaguered cookie. The Information has some details, gleaned from three unnamed sources. “Facebook has been pouring resources into Atlas in advance of a big new push with the product, expected to coincide with the Advertising Week trade show in late September, according to three people familiar with the plans.” (Subscription required <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D8BqA0020P0WoAYU00> ) Pair with this AdExchanger column <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L08qW0D00MAgB0Y4PA>  on Facebook’s and Google’s opportunity to reinvent the ad server with cross-device identity at the core.

Content Reco By Yahoo

Internet users will be seeing Yahoo-powered content recommendation boxes on a handful of publisher sites, including CBS Interactive and Vox Media's SB Nation, according to an AdAge report. "The native ad network would be one way for Yahoo to take advantage of advertisers' interest in its so-called native Stream Ads and offset the company's years-long display revenue declines," according to the story. Yahoo's maneuver comes in the wake of last month's Flurry acquisition <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0080pY0WVDP0L0A00> , at which time SVP Scott Burke shared that Yahoo is planning to launch a mobile ad network. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pq40Y0DWA8q2> , with screenshot!

NYT Paywall Hits Wall

As The New York Times keeps tweaking the balance of ads and subs to drive optimal audience engagement and revenue, there are hints its digital paywall ranks are near capacity. "Slowdown in digital subscribers means it’ll be that much harder for the Times to make up for its losses elsewhere," writes Re/code's Edmund Lee, "specifically in advertising, once the life-blood of the business." From 2011 to last year, the Times lost nearly $90 million in ad revenue. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0rX02q0L0AB0D800AY4> . Pair with AdExchanger’s coverage of NYT’s programmatic moves <http://go.adexchanger.com/TY0WY0P08000DBs20L4qAA0> .

Social Bait

Facebook wants to reduce the click-bait headlines that have given rise to a range of BuzzFeed wannabes, fueled by paid and organic placements in the news feed. Two new updates respond to Facebook user survey data, in which 80% said they preferred headlines that accurately reflected the attached content. Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqZB082LW004D0P0AAt0Y00> . It may be getting harder for new publishers to rely on social referrals.

*	The Sell Sider Column… Everyone Has A Monetization Platform For Publishers <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP05w02q0L0AB0D800AT4>  Michael Persaud, director of programmatic advertising at Wenner Media, advises publishers to "Drill down on ways the vendor's solution can fit within your current ad stack while providing true incremental revenue or competitive advantage. Chances are you are not going to kill an existing relationship based on the hope that an untested product performs better...'"
*	Data-Driven Thinking Column… Will 2015 Will Be The Year Of Private Marketplaces? <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLP864B00W000qAT0020AxD>  "In the last year many publishers have identified one person to work with, rather than a site direct sales person and a programmatic sales person," says The Media Kitchen President Barry Lowenthal. It’s become commonplace, especially among the sophisticated publishers, to have one point of contact supported by a team of programmatic tech people..."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Extending Amazon’s Data

As part of a test, Amazon has been placing display ads on some affiliate sites and paying on an impression (not conversion) basis. Blogger David Zatz takes the feature for a test drive and is pleasantly surprised despite minor bugs. "Amazon didn’t appear to honor my target CPM ($2), " Zatz wrote on Friday <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBE000AT80A200WL4qPd00> . "But implementation and accessibility is dead simple. And, unlike Google Adsense [sic] which is primarily pay-per-click, Amazon CPM Ads are impression-based – an approach that hasn’t always been readily available to smaller sites." Legions of publisher sites are part of the Amazon Associates affiliate program, creating an opportunity to extend the Amazon data set through more display placements in a way that the company can tightly control.

Cumulonimbus 

Cloud software giant Salesforce.com reported total revenue of $1.3 billion for Q2 late last week, a big jump. “I don’t think there’s ever been a software that has grown at 38% at the $5 billion revenue line,” chirped CEO Marc Benioff. “We also had just phenomenal execution of our ExactTarget acquisition. … We’ve deeply integrated that into our enterprise.” Earnings release <http://go.adexchanger.com/B800FW2A000040TB0DeLPqA> . ExactTarget, which cost the company a pretty penny ($2.5 billion) last year, bid farewell to CEO Scott Dorsey in May following the exit of Salesforce.com’s social ads offering VP, Peter Goodman.

Cookie Canvas

Writing for VentureBeat, Semcasting CEO Ray Kingman says a new cookie-free tracking method, known in some corners as Canvas Fingerprinting, is "playing with fire." What's more, according to Kingman, it might not work. Kingman suggests that everyone “step away from the JAVA code for a moment and get back to basics. Ad tech companies need to start thinking like marketing companies and focus on methods that improve the scale and quality of their reach. They need to recognize that they already have the ability to accurately serve audiences at scale without using cookies, universal IDs, or (especially) canvas fingerprinting.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P08GA0000q0Df20LAWT> . Or, learn more about Canvas Fingerprinting <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0080gT0WHDP0L0A00> , via researchers at Princeton and KU Leuven, a Belgian university.

Programmatic And APAC

PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel spoke to Campaign Asia-Pacific about why automated ad buying has been slow to grow in APAC. According to Goel, the fragmentation of markets across Southeast Asia, Japan, China and Australia has hindered publishers from adopting programmatic strategies in earnest. But as PubMatic ramps up in the region, Goel doesn’t anticipate a tough sell. <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqIB082LW004D0P0AAh0T00> 

Data-Driven DC

Extreme partisanship reigns in the capitol, but Dems and Republicans have found common cause in data-driven politicking on TV screens. The Washington Post reports DirecTV and Dish Network viewers can expect to encounter super personalized ads this election season, orchestrated through a DirecTV and Dish Network partnership dubbed "D2." The ads will know in advance whether viewers are likely to vote absentee, if they're undecided or if their loyalties lie with a specific party.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Recommendation Backlash

Outbrain and Taboola, content recommendation companies and direct competitors, are both battling some negative perceptions from the public, Fortune reported Wednesday. Publishers stand to earn a lot through Taboola and Outbrain's services, as do advertisers – on the order of hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of dollars annually, according to Fortune. But the public tires of seeing what they consider to be poor-quality content at the end of their clicks. As a rebuttal, Outbrain CEO Yaron Galai says backlash comes from "people that are into ad blocking and think content for free is our birthright. That’s kind of whiny to me.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LJ72oADP0800A0> .

Installing Globally

On its Inside AdWords blog, Google announced the global rollout of app promotion ads for Search and YouTube. They were launched in June on the Google Display Network. AdExchanger covered the first sprigs of the announcement back in April <http://go.adexchanger.com/r4080A2J0BpLD0W8P00q0A0> . On Wednesday, Jerry Dischler, Google’s VP of product management, blogged about one benefit: “You can deep link users directly from Google Search into specific pages of apps they’ve already installed.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/r4090A2J0BqLD0W8P00q0A0> .

Flooding The News Feed

On Tuesday, news surfaced that Facebook increased its ad frequency cap. Part of Facebook's policy update included the tweak that users would no longer need to "like" a brand in order for that brand to serve ads. Then on Wednesday, TechCrunch reported an eerily similar story regarding Twitter. Twitter's tweaks on Wednesday also involved its news feed. Now users may see content from Twitter handles they don't follow, some of which Twitter plans to inject into its feed algorithmically. The update is only running on Twitter's iOS and Mobile apps. Read on via TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DaA02000BWJ0q48rLP0A> .

SMB Strategy

On Wednesday, domain host giant GoDaddy bought Mad Mimi for an undisclosed sum. Through the acquisition, Mad Mimi's email marketing service will replace GoDaddy's product, "Easy Email Marketing." The move mirrors several recent GoDaddy buys (Locu, Media Temple, Ronin, Afternic, M.dot, Canary and Outright), all of which seek to expand the company's SMB customer base and offerings. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/I080bWD0L4Ps0A2q0J0BA00> .

Digital Supersize

On Tuesday, McDonald’s appointed Julie Vander Ploeg as the company's first-ever US VP of digital, and in this week's The Drift column, Doug Weaver take a step back to consider what it all means. McDonald’s didn’t make advertising the focus of the hire, says Weaver. But maybe, he says, digital advertising is less about serving ads and more about industrywide consolidation. "The bigger and more multi-dimensional we become (with social, native, data-driven decision making and more)," he writes, "the more anachronistic and restrictive the conventions of advertising become. … Brand engagement and enhancing the customer's retail experience can't even be contained by marketing, let alone advertising.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP8c0Jq0AD00B4t020W0> .

More App Stores

Verizon is gearing up to launch its very own app store, The Verge reported on Wednesday. The mobile carrier’s digital boutique will compete directly with the Google Play store, in addition to Sprint's newly established store, the App Pass. Verizon will have to entice developers away from the competition with something other than the ability to tack app purchases onto monthly bills, according the The Verge. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/AJ0u04WB200A8Pq00L0d0DA> . But… Re/code gets a Verizon rep to say <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0eJ0L80DB0v0W0q4P20A0A>  this is not happening.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Publisher’s Promise

The Telegraph released a letter to its advertisers in an effort to soothe any concerns regarding a lack of transparency in programmatic trading. The letter reads like a list of guarantees, and The Telegraph is calling it its “Customer Charter.” Sales and trading director Jim Freeman and client director Melanie Danks co-authored the letter, in which they promise clients that every investment on ad impressions will deliver "Real people (No Click Bots); a quality and engaging environment to ensure context and attention; a more affluent audience than Facebook, Yahoo, MSN, AOL and all other Newsbrands; quality and engaging content produced by a network of over 500 journalists across the world with the most sophisticated state of the art tools at their disposal; and the most loyal and data rich audience in Newsbrands." The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00EJ0ALAWPV8B02q000> .

Raising The Ad Cap

Facebook is raising its daily per-advertiser frequency cap, according to an email briefing first reported by Digiday. Although the total number of ads a Facebook user is exposed to daily will not increase, the move grants advertisers permission to serve ads to users who've not "liked" their brand page. Speaking to Digiday, M80 President Jeff Semones says the increased frequency cap serves as yet another reminder that Facebook is not, at its core, a social network. “We tell our clients to think of Facebook less like a social network, and more like an advertising network," he said. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000P8W00q2K0E> .

Uber Gets Into Attribution

Sure, that headline is a stretch –for now. On Tuesday, Uber made public news of a new same-day delivery service via a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PXB00000AE4Dq028WL0> . Uber is test-driving the offering, which the company is calling Cornerstone, currently only available in DC. For now, delivery options are also limited to a list of 100 household products Uber users can access through the app. Wouldn’t a CPG or two like to get its hands on that data at scale? Of course, a healthy amount of skepticism around delivery continues to pervade the industry. "[Delivery] didn’t work then, and it won’t work now, unless you’re a tech giant who doesn’t mind losing money to win over consumers," Rick Heitzmann, a tech investor with FirstMark Capital, told The Verge <http://go.adexchanger.com/AE0Y04WB200A8Pq00L0M0DA> .

Broadcast Declines Ahead?

Broadcast network TV ratings could take a hit next year, according to GroupM Chief Investment Officer Rino Scanzoni. Speaking to MediaPost, Scanzoni estimated declines of 6% or 7%, a steeper decline than the typical 4% to 5% in recent years. This past season benefited from both the Winter Olympics and the World Cup, but next season could suffer. Read on via MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PZBND000qA2E04L08> .

Touch To Buy

PayPal and Braintree unveiled a one-touch payment tool on Tuesday that is launching with a handful of merchant partners. The offering is akin to Venmo Touch, which surfaced last year. The buy button is rolling out in beta on iOS exclusively, but will be available on Android when the tool launches officially in September. “I think one-touch buying will really be foundational over the next couple years," Braintree CEO Bill Ready told VentureBeat, "where devices without keyboard become primary computing devices."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Publisher’s Promise

The Telegraph released a letter to its advertisers in an effort to soothe any concerns regarding a lack of transparency in programmatic trading. The letter reads like a list of guarantees, and The Telegraph is calling it its “Customer Charter.” Sales and trading director Jim Freeman and client director Melanie Danks co-authored the letter, in which they promise clients that every investment on ad impressions will deliver "Real people (No Click Bots); a quality and engaging environment to ensure context and attention; a more affluent audience than Facebook, Yahoo, MSN, AOL and all other Newsbrands; quality and engaging content produced by a network of over 500 journalists across the world with the most sophisticated state of the art tools at their disposal; and the most loyal and data rich audience in Newsbrands."

Raising The Ad Cap

Facebook is raising its daily per-advertiser frequency cap, according to an email briefing first reported by Digiday. Although the total number of ads a Facebook user is exposed to daily will not increase, the move grants advertisers permission to serve ads to users who've not "liked" their brand page. Speaking to Digiday, M80 President Jeff Semones says the increased frequency cap serves as yet another reminder that Facebook is not, at its core, a social network. “We tell our clients to think of Facebook less like a social network, and more like an advertising network," he said.

Uber Gets Into Attribution

Sure, that headline is a stretch –for now. On Tuesday, Uber made public news of a new same-day delivery service via a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00A50ALAWPd8B02q000> . Uber is test-driving the offering, which the company is calling Cornerstone, currently only available in DC. For now, delivery options are also limited to a list of 100 household products Uber users can access through the app. Wouldn’t a CPG or two like to get its hands on that data at scale? Of course, a healthy amount of skepticism around delivery continues to pervade the industry. "[Delivery] didn’t work then, and it won’t work now, unless you’re a tech giant who doesn’t mind losing money to win over consumers," Rick Heitzmann, a tech investor with FirstMark Capital, told The Verge <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqeB082LW004D0P0AA60A00> .

Broadcast Declines Ahead?

Broadcast network TV ratings could take a hit next year, according to GroupM Chief Investment Officer Rino Scanzoni. Speaking to MediaPost, Scanzoni estimated declines of 6% or 7%, a steeper decline than the typical 4% to 5% in recent years. This past season benefited from both the Winter Olympics and the World Cup, but next season could suffer. Read on via MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00A70ALAWPf8B02q000> .

Touch To Buy

PayPal and Braintree unveiled a one-touch payment tool on Tuesday that is launching with a handful of merchant partners. The offering is akin to Venmo Touch, which surfaced last year. The buy button is rolling out in beta on iOS exclusively, but will be available on Android when the tool launches officially in September. “I think one-touch buying will really be foundational over the next couple years," Braintree CEO Bill Ready told VentureBeat, "where devices without keyboard become primary computing devices."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Boutique Arbitrage

On Monday, Ad Age profiled a small digital agency whose atypical business strategy might signal a growing trend. IMM is a Boulder, Colo.-based shop with a head count of 100, and the company is practicing arbitrage (typically undertaken by much larger companies). But shouldering the risk of buying media for clients before receiving compensation seems to be paying off for IMM, and the shop already works with some heavyweight clients like Chili's and Quiznos. The secret to success, according to Ad Age, is taking a cue from the major industry players: "On the programmatic front, IMM's arbitrage model is not too dissimilar from that of GroupM's Xaxis."

Google’s Caller ID

Google unleashed a new product on Monday designed to track when online ad impressions lead to phone calls. The latest addition to Google Adwords is Website Call Conversions, which marketers can adopt through the addition of several codes to their web pages. Google’s blogged <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0qt8WPr0A00>  install instructions explain, "After setting up conversion tracking for calls … we'll replace your business phone number on your site with a Google forwarding number for people who have clicked on your ad." TechCrunch's Frederic Lardinois says the tool could help advertisers optimize their ads and bids to drive the calls that will likely unearth sales leads.

Data In Danger

Dstillery CEO Tom Phillips spoke to Street Fight on Monday and discussed how the shift of ad spend from desktop to mobile can compromise data. According to Phillips, there's a data problem many in the industry are refusing to call fraud. “The infrastructure of programmatic advertising allows you to harness data in real-time, and that’s why it’s so important across all media that we solve the data problem,” explained Phillips. “Buying programmatically is not just an efficiency play anymore; its opens up the possibility of all sorts of new tools and strategies to do it better.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqtP04A0LB0WAt0280000sD> .

Crowdsourcing Algorithms

Seattle-based startup Algorithmia is betting on the value of a marketplace for algorithms and just received a $2.4 million injection to fuel its aim. The platform, designed and developed by co-founders Kenny Daniel and Diego Oppenheimer, offers a place for algorithms to be uploaded, tested and exchanged. To monetize initially, the startup charges a base price, and developers who upload algorithms are compensated depending on how often their code is used. "It’s a crowdsourced approach to artificial intelligence," said Oppenheimer. Read on at VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0uL0000tP02BAqD80t40A> .

Investing In Ad Tech

Despite an increase in overall ad spend on web-based spots, younger companies are not quite delivering to investors the desired returns, says an article from The Wall Street Journal. Google and Facebook's investors aren't struggling, but for newer companies like Rocket Fuel, YuMe, Rubicon Project and Tremor Video, the surge in recent annual revenue does not necessarily translate to ideal net loss figures. What it means for the growing online advertising business could be delayed (or undervalued) IPOs, according to the Journal. "Investors truly don't understand the space at all," said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D8BqA0020P0WuAtv00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Buying Into Anti-Fraud

Yahoo gobbled up Israel-based startup ClarityRay <http://go.adexchanger.com/y8oWDqP00A0LABF04B00020>  on Friday for an undisclosed sum. ClarityRay began as an ad-blocking firm, but has since evolved to an ad-security and fraud-detection company. A spokesperson for Yahoo told TechCrunch, "Advertising is an essential part of our business here at Yahoo, and we’re committed to getting it right. ClarityRay is a company with deep expertise in ad-malware detection and prevention. The bottom line for Yahoo is that search is going to get better and safer for users, and advertising will become more reliable and profitable for partners." Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00C0GL0oW00AD2q08A04> . LinkedIn says <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP8H0oq0AD00B4D020W0>  ClarityRay has six employees, and so does a mouseover of the ClarityRay logo here <http://go.adexchanger.com/y8oWDqP00A0LABF04B00020> . It’s an acqui-hire for a Yahoo ads future.

Goodbye, Exactness

On Google’s AdWords blog, product manager Jen Huang announced it would not be possible to target exact matches of keyword phrases in Google pay-per-click search ad campaigns. Read the post <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBE000Ao80A200WL4qPI00> . Instead, she explained, “In late September, we’re applying close variant keyword matching <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLoWJ0AP8F020qD40> , an intuitive way to connect people with the businesses they’re searching for, to all exact and phrase match keywords.” So, is this more inexact? Search Engine Land reports that there will be no effect for “97% of advertisers” and taps WordStream’s Larry Kim, who sees efficiency and “a shift towards more object based advertising (think PLAs). [We] are heading towards a ‘keywordless’ world, and this is a step in that direction.” The step is an interesting echo to Google removing the ability to see search engine query data (what phrases and how many) from Google Analytics, for example. Pre-emptive privacy-related moves or circling the wagons around Google’s priceless first-party intent data?

New Yahoo Display

Former Yahoo display ad engineering exec Jeff Minich responds to recent criticism <http://go.adexchanger.com/uK0000DB4L0A0G02oPqWA80>  of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and says greener pastures are ahead for Yahoo in spite of what may have appeared to be missteps in the past. He writes in Business Insider, “What I didn’t get then, but understand now, is Marissa most likely made a conscious decision to put the legacy display business on the backburner to focus on building a new, more modern monetization platform capable of driving predictable and systematic long-term growth for Yahoo.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0Lo8WPH0A00> . Meanwhile, Yahoo is slowly taking the wraps off of a self-serve demand-side platform ad tool for Yahoo “premium” ads, says Ad Age’s Tim Peterson <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP8M0oq0AD00B4I020W0> .

Global Ad Forecast

GroupM is predicting that global advertising investment will hit $534 billion by the end of the year, the holding company said in its twice-yearly “This Year, Next Year” report. In 2015, GroupM predicts that number to grow by 5%, to hit $560 billion. "Coupled with a rising general confidence and a specific comfort around digital marketing, though notwithstanding some geo-political uncertainty, we are seeing an uplift in some of the ‘older economies’ as well as the new," said GroupM Global President Dominic Proctor in a release. Read on via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00J0NL0oW00AD2q08A04> .

Tech Corps Accused

The Center for Digital Democracy’s (CDD) Jeff Chester has asked that the FTC investigate a group of tech firms and data brokers concerning potential violations of Safe Harbor data. The CDD lists grievances that include a lack of transparency, disregard for consent and a general breach of Safe Harbor laws. In a CDD statement, 30 companies are accused of "compiling, using and sharing EU consumers’ personal information without their awareness and meaningful consent.” On the list of accused companies are Acxiom, Bizo, BlueKai, Criteo, DataXu, Salesforce.com, Turn and Xaxis.

Patent Problems

Vringo, cell phone ring-tone vendor turned patent-licensing firm, lost an appeals court ruling, Bloomberg reported Friday. Google launched the case and won its bid to overturn a patent-infringement verdict worth $30.5 million. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit discounted Vringo's claim that its filtering tech brought new insights to ad placements for search, which Google used for its AdWords and AdSense search products. Circuit Judge Haldane Mayer explained the verdict, saying the "claimed system is merely an Internet iteration of the basic concept of combining content and collaborative data. Moreover, the scope of the claimed invention is staggering, potentially covering a significant portion of all online advertising.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D8BqA0020P0WQAoM00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

A Battle For The Wages

Writing for The Wall Street Journal, 4A CEO Nancy Hill comes to a pretty grim conclusion <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B08AAE0DQg00>  as to why the ad industry is starved for talent. With student loans on the rise, and with low average entry salaries in the ad biz, not all grads can afford to work in the industry. On Wednesday, ANA CEO Bob Liodice stepped into the ring <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqFP04A0LB0WAg0280000RD> . Agreeing with an apparent industrywide thirst for talent, Liodice argues that low entry wages have been endemic to advertising for decades. And the adoption of programmatic strategies and a move to take media in-house have compounded the problem, he says. WSJ's Mike Shields takes a look at both sides of the debate <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqFP04A0LB0WAg0280000RD> .

Worlds Collide

Marketing automation and advertising technology are coming together through software integration, reports Ad Age. Although both fields have separate target audiences and aims says Ad Age, recent M&A suggests a turning of the tides. Marketing automation provider Marketo, for example, integrated with data provider Acxiom in recent months, in addition to programmatic ad-buying platform Turn. "I don't think you've seen anybody yet articulate how a [automated ad-buying platform] fits literally in the business process workflow with a marketing automation system," said Marketo CEO Phil Fernandez. "We intend to do that and to do that soon." Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LP8S0gq0AD00B4G020W0> .

Video Attribution

Conversion Logic, the startup endeavor of two former Visual IQ VPs, is coming out of stealth. The company’s goal is to help advertisers track and measure the effectiveness of video campaigns across devices. Cross-device attribution is, according to Conversion Logic CEO Trevor Testwuide, “relatively new technology … [which] has moved from the analytics professional to advertising and marketing, then to strategy and then media," he said, adding, "Our clients are any data-driven company that wants to optimize ad spend in a holistic way.” In addition to launching on Thursday, Testwuide and co-founder Alison Lohse also unveiled a total $1.1 million in funding raised through a "founders' round." Read more via TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0Tg0L80DB0H0W0q4P20A0A> .

The Native Debate Deepens

In this week's The Drift, Doug Weaver reviews the native ads trend. Weaver writes that separation of church and state, for advertising, "worked about as well on Madison Avenue as … in Tudor England." Weaver also takes issue with the assumption that marketers and agencies aren't producing winning storytelling. It's much harder to move an audience with a banner ad, he writes, which is why marketers will explore every other available marketing channel – "packaging, publicity, events, public relations, retailer relationships, infomercials and, yes, native advertising.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ag0I04WB200A8Pq00L0U0DA> .

Social Path To Purchase

When it comes to driving offline sales for small businesses, Facebook is king of the social sites, according to a new study by marketing company G/O Digital. The research surveyed 1,000 social media users in the US, aged 18 to 29. Participants who consider Facebook to be the most useful social media for product research before in-store purchases were a resounding 62%. Pinterest and Twitter were neck and neck for second and third, at 12% and 11% respectively. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0VJ02q0L0AB0D800Ag4> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

More AOL Acquisitions?

On Tuesday, AOL said it will offer $300 million of convertible senior notes. This marks the first time that AOL has offered bonds since 2009, when the company broke away from Time Warner. According to The Wall Street Journal  <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000P8P00q250c> , AOL will use its bond earnings to fund new acquisitions and to buy back a portion of sold AOL stock. The notes will be exclusively available to qualified institutional buyers, and are expected to mature on Sept. 1st, 2019. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/lcBqQ000L8DP0A2A400060W> .

LinkedIn’s B2B Master Plan

LinkedIn's got big plans to build a $1 billion B2B marketing business by 2017, according to internal documents first reported by Business Insider. The strategy follows in the wake of LinkedIn's recent decision to buy business-marketing company Bizo. The document clearly states, "Our long-term ambition is to build an integrated marketing and sales platform that provides a simple and effective way to reach audiences, nurture prospects, and acquire customers." LinkedIn VP of Corporate Communications Shannon Stubo Brayton declined to comment. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00cA0L0D7008B2qW0ARP04> .

YouTube Boss Talks

YouTube's new(ish) head, Susan Wojcicki, spoke to Re/code about her transition, M&A and the company’s focus on advertising around its creators. “‘Google Preferred’ is a mechanism where we can get our top one percent or five percent to get more ad dollars, and really feature them,” she explained. “We’re doing advertisements promoting them as brands, like Vice and [Maker Studios’] Epic Rap Battles. Because we realize that promotion is a very significant part of the equation.” Wojcicki added that these sorts of ads have had a significant effect on brand lift and awareness, in addition to driving traffic.

High Standards For Sponsored

BuzzFeed expects to generate around $120 million in native ad sales this year alone, according to TechCrunch. But in so doing, the publisher risks jeopardizing its brand and, ultimately, alienating its readership. For a publisher that has rejected banner ads since day one, BuzzFeed invests a lot of time, talent and resources into generating native content for its brand partners. TechCrunch's Josh Constine suggests two things for BuzzFeed's long game: increased selectivity for native spots and targeted efforts to drive more traffic to its home page.

Addressing (In)Visibility

Viewability and video analytics provider Veenome launched an intelligence tool on Wednesday, designed specifically for measurement on YouTube. Dubbed the YouTube Channel Content Analytics tool, the tech can analyze video and audio content on any given channel and offer statistics to advertisers before ads are placed. This could help marketers strategize before ever launching a campaign, and is a step in the right direction toward addressing an industrywide lack of viewability. Adweek has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PUB00000Ac4Dq028Wa0> .

Native Backlash

Writing for Digiday, JWT Atlanta's Todd Copilevitz takes an unapologetic stand against native advertising. Copilevitz, a partner of digital strategy, makes a case against the hype, arguing it’s on marketers to create meaningful content independent of publishers. “Why is editorial content so powerful?” he asks. “Because it doesn’t sell. It informs, tells a story, pulls back a curtain. So take a cue from that and figure out what stories your brand has to share.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000P8W00q2c0c> .

Pursway unveiled <http://go.adexchanger.com/q8AW0A0DLj004402B0PH00q>  an audience extension platform on Tuesday, dubbed Pursway Connect. Simply put, the platform helps markets identify and reach “real-life” friends of their known target audience, thereby extending a marketer's overall pool of targets. Pursway Connect is only available for direct mail and social media targeting, but the company plans to expand to online and mobile channels as well. The more (people) you know.

Poor Mobile Ads

Consumers are most likely to engage with TV ads, according to research by City Numbers. Of the 1,006 consumers studied, 79% said they'd engage with TV ads, 62% cited direct mail and 53% preferred print ads. "More traditional tactics are holding their own in a marketplace that demands increasingly diverse and integrated marketing campaigns, while it’s clear that unsolicited calls to the home or mobile remain as unpopular as ever," said City Numbers Managing Director Craig Busst. Unsurprisingly, marketing calls were particularly unpopular, at 6%. But mobile advertising ranked dead last, at 5%. Read on via The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PlBJD000qA2404L08> .

Pinterest Seeking Media Exec

Pinterest is in the market to improve its media relations and strengthen its publisher ties. The scrapbooking site is looking to hire a partner manager of media, a move that "puts Pinterest squarely in the path of Facebook and Twitter, who compete aggressively for media partnerships and attention," according to Gigaom. One Pinterest spokeswoman explained the pivot thusly: "Media is a growing category and is an interest for many. We want to make sure articles are high quality and discoverable on Pinterest, so we launched article pins, and we’re working with publications to help them be successful."

Seismic RTB

Riding the coattails of Sizmek's Aerify acquisition <http://go.adexchanger.com/B800nW2A0000404B0DLLPqA>  on Monday, MediaPost's Tyler Loechner spoke to Mike Caprio, GM of Sizmek's new RTB team, Sizmek Vantage. The Sizmek Vantage group works to help agencies, brands and trading desks transition to RTB (real-time bidding). Theorizing on what role programmatic will play as ad spend shifts to digital, Carpio said, “I believe there will continue to be private market (i.e., upfront-type) deals, and then RTB open market (scatter) deals. You are starting to see these private marketplaces forming now with FreeWheel and others. But I think the biggest driver will be with dollars earmarked for the scatter TV markets that can be more efficiently targeted within online RTB.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40M0A240BoLD0W8P00q0A0> .

Dude, Yo Is Serious

Skeptics of Yo had reason to doubt the value of the one-word messaging app when it first surfaced. The company unveiled its "Yo Index" on Tuesday, in addition to a hashtag function, that lets users curate a selection of sources from which they'd like to receive updates. For example, if a friend posts a photo on Instagram, a user can be "Yo'd." According to TechCrunch, "The updates sketch out a clear focus on marketing, with Yo looking to become a platform for branded n(y)otifications."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

BuzzFeed Optimizes Bank

On Monday, BuzzFeed closed a $50 million investment deal from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. With the new injection of cash, BuzzFeed boats a $850 million valuation, according to The New York Times. The online publisher will likely use the funds to broaden its content offerings and deepen its in-house advertising arm. Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, explained that the investment in BuzzFeed had a lot to do with the company’s huge social reach. “We think of BuzzFeed as more of a technology company. They embrace Internet culture. Everything is first optimized for mobile and social channels.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00XA0L0DH007B2qW0AbP04> .

Native Blasts Off

Thrillist is on a space-themed mission to prove native advertising leads to direct sales, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Working with General Electric, the lifestyle guide launched a native campaign to market a line of limited-edition shoes, produced by GE, by linking native ad spots directly to JackThreads.com. Thrillist began the campaign in early July, leading up to the 45th anniversary of the lunar landing. The rare sneakers snuck their way alongside space-based posts on Thrillist, the connecting thread being that GE made the rubber used in the moon boots worn that historic day in 1969. The shoes sold out (100 pairs at $195 = $19,500 total revenue). But they were so coveted that consumers were paying as much as $2,000 a pair on eBay. Thrillist Vice President for Integrated Marketing Paul Josephsen adds that readers spend 30% more time on sponsored content. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/q7AW0A0DLc004X02B0PI00q> . But how scalable is this?

Buying Into Programmatic TV

Mediahub and Videology are working together, the companies revealed on Monday. Mediahub, the media division of Boston-based agency Mullen, tapped programmatic video ad platform Videology to help address and develop digital video and TV offerings for its clients. Said Sean Corcoran, Mullen’s SVP and director of digital media, "It's a one TV/digital video world, and we're trying to plan and prepare for that. We're looking for partners that can help plan across screens and that can manage the data under one roof.” Adweek has the story <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PJ40X0DdA7q2> .

Couponing Chat

The ever-evolving messaging app Snapchat is continuing to graduate its offerings, this time through a partnership with Groupon. Through the coupling, the ephemeral photo-sharing facilitator and Groupon will serve time-sensitive offers to SnapChat users, who will have to follow Groupon.com in order to receive deals. The partnership makes sense for Groupon, as it purportedly looks to expand its offerings from just couponing to include ecommerce tools such as a payment processing function. And since more than half of Groupon’s transactions come from mobile, all the more reason to start snapping. Lets Talk Payments has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/lXBqe000L7DP0A2A4000K0W> .

Consolidating Conversations

On Monday, ecommerce site BeachMint gained all operational control of Lucky Magazine, a realignment that's all part of BeachMint's recent joint venture with Condé Nast. The partnership makes sense, according to TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00XL0ALAWPf7B02q000> , as retailers and publishers alike struggle to monetize through content.In an oddly similar turn of events, Epicurious.com's general manager, Carolyn Kremins, is exiting Condé Nast, and Bon Appetit VP-Publisher Pamela Drucker Mann will manage both publications. Now, marketers looking to reach audiences across both magazines will have a centralized plan of attack. "We were having separate conversations with advertisers," Drucker Mann told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqgP04A0LB0WAX0270000MD> . "Now we can have one conversation."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

What’s With The M&A?

The NY Times explores the recent mergers and acquisitions trend – and what it means. NYT writers explain, “To some on Wall Street, the deal-making may not in fact be an indicator of golden years ahead. Optimism about economic growth may not be the sole driver of the boom in acquisitions, they assert. Instead, some chief executives may have come to view takeovers as the only way to obtain big increases in revenue in a still lackluster economy. If the deals then disappoint, the economy could also suffer.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/F7DBL00zY0W0P2Sq000AA04> .

Flexibility Is Key

Some marketers have a beef with WPP's programmatic arm Xaxis, particularly where it comes to taking a position on media and with its requisite nondisclosure agreements. Ad Age reports that WPP recognizes the tension, and is offering a more flexible automation option – in the hopes clients aren’t tempted to take programmatic buying in-house. "We'll go back to clients who previously may have said, 'We won't use Xaxis,'" explains GroupM Chief Digital Officer Rob Norman, "and say we're creating value here, and here's a mechanism for clients to test Xaxis inventory in the open market against other inventory sources." Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W07ZA0q0A0BAL0PDS2> .

Missing Direct Sales Demand

Demand Media, whose owned and operated sites include eHow.com and Livestrong.com, reported its second-quarter earnings late last week. Revenue (excluding traffic acquisition costs) was $87.1 million, a 10% decrease YoY. Advertising revenue saw a similar decline, at $31 million, a 33% decrease YoY. Interim CEO Shawn J. Colo attributed the figures, in part, to the company's strategic shift to programmatic solutions, "which currently have a lower CPM than higher-touch direct ad sales." But despite the decline in revenue, Colo was satisfied with how automation has helped to grow Demand Media's business. "We've seen some real traction in terms of onboarding clients,” said Colo. “I think we tripled the number of live deals during the quarter, now we've got a couple hundred brands and agencies who are looking at our inventory." Seeking Alpha has the transcript <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0070BS0W0DP0L0A00> or see the earnings report <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D7BqA0020P0WCAS100> .

Programmatic News Corp.

News Corporation’s quarterly revenue fell short of projections, at $8.6 billion, a 4% decrease YoY. The Q4 earnings come at a time of transition for the behemoth publisher, as the corporation seeks to diversify its revenue streams and expand its digital foothold through a series of strategic acquisitions. During the call, CEO Robert Thomson shared with investors a strong focus on automation. “We successfully launched the global programmatic advertising exchange,” he said, “which has helped us cut out third-party networks and allowed us to work directly with advertisers who want to reach our premium audiences.” Taking ownership of data, said Thomson, is key. Read the transcript <http://go.adexchanger.com/lSBq2000L7DP0A2A4000D0W> .

Square-ly In Marketing Tech

On his personal blog, Opus analyst Greg Sterling posits that the future of payment tech company Square may be in marketing services for the SMB market. Sterling notes a few products already in market and adds, “It would not that far-fetched for Square to follow GoDaddy, for example, into marketing services. Most SMBs want to work with one trusted provider. When they find that company or individual they start asking for all kinds of additional advice and services.” Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWS47A003L0PB0E2> . Seems reasonable – along with the fact that former Google AdSense and Facebook ads engineering guru Gokul Rajaram <http://go.adexchanger.com/F7DBL00F40W0P2Sq000AA04>  leads tech development over at Square.

Messaging Ads

China's new restrictions on messaging services may have a silver lining for Chinese holding company Tencent. At least for advertising, says the WSJ. The new rules will censor the kinds of messaging accounts that can post political news, creating "official accounts" instead. Tencent owns WeChat and QQ, and the messaging services are dominant among Chinese users. But the company's tight identification policies might drive up the value of the messaging app's user data from a marketing perspective.

How would this enable more “programmatic” marketing across anonymous and known user states?

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Addressing Television

The Drum prodded agency execs from Starcom Mediavest Group (SMG), VivaKi and Carat for insights on programmatic television. “Linear TV won’t go away – but as more digital video inventory within exchanges opens up, we will continue to look to programmatic to complement our linear TV campaigns,” said Carat Global President Doug Ray. “Buying audience – not buying content – is fundamentally where we will go." Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LLa2sADP0700A0> .

Twitter Performance

Twitter rolled out some shiny new performance tools Thursday. New “objective-based” campaigns will charge marketers only for designated actions. "We’ll continue to enhance our campaign creation and reporting capabilities so that you can optimize for your unique marketing objectives," explained Twitter via a blog post, "whether you’re a small business setting up your first Twitter Ads campaign or a large ad agency running hundreds of campaigns." Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PtB00000AL4Dq027Wb0> .

Native Breakdown

Sixty-nine percent of marketers acknowledge the value of native advertising, but only 22% see the format taking a primary role in the future of digital advertising. Those are among the findings of a new report, conducted by 614 Group and OneSpot, that also touches on larger digital marketing trends. Pay with some PII. <http://go.adexchanger.com/y7LWDqP00A0LABc04u00020> 

Beautiful Data

Beauty data startup Poshly raised $1.5 million. According to a press release, “Poshly has developed a platform that incentivizes consumers to share insights about themselves and their product preferences. Brands, agencies and publishers in the beauty vertical ... use Poshly’s aggregated data for real-time consumer insights and targeting.” TechCrunch has more. <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4D7BqA0020P0WdALv00> 

Trust In Facebook

Facebook aims to bulk up its server security by acquiring  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0wL0000LP02BAqD70e40A> PrivateCore. The investment comes as Facebook revs up its foray into ecommerce – specifically using Facebook as a buying platform <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B07AAx0DfL00> , rather than linking users to a third-party retailer. Recently, the company said it would develop a “buy” button aimed at small and medium-sized merchants. If Facebook decides to start handling payment histories and information, then it needs to level up its security.

Mid-Market Blues

Facebook's declining organic reach, coupled with rising ad prices, may be edging out small and medium-sized businesses. According to a Thursday feature in The Wall Street Journal, Facebook claims rising prices result in more efficient, high-quality ads. But for businesses on a tight budget, Facebook's top-line gains are causing pain. The average per ad price increased 123% year over year, while impressions declined a whopping 25%. But don't worry, Momandpop.com, Facebook's ad revenue rose 67% in the most recent quarter. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW07z0B4L0h2AAP00q0DL00> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Creative Ads

In announcing the one-year anniversary of its Google Web Designer <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4F030P00qD002LBW0RA7>  product, which offers HTML5 integration for creating ads, the DoubleClick Advertiser blog shares some stats that it claims show traction, including: “In the first half of 2014, DoubleClick Rich Media ad impressions from HTML5 grew 140% compared to the second half of 2013; Ads built with Google Web Designer have garnered 2.5B impressions since the launch of the product; Over 20% of Google Web Designer’s user base are returning users and 72% are located outside the United States.” The creative and media inexorably merge. Read about new product updates <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB4000AF70A200WL4qPS00> .

The Buzz

BuzzFeed's new president has big programmatic aspirations, according to Ad Age. In a Q&A published Wednesday, Greg Coleman touched on native, mobile and video strategies. But for a publisher that has vehemently rejected banner ads from the start, tapping into programmatic has proved difficult for BuzzFeed. Still, Coleman is hoping to find a way to automate. "Getting into the world of programmatic is going to take a lot of work, ingenuity and creativity. And maybe we won't get there,” he said. “We're certainly going to put our heads together to see if there is a really intelligent way … [to] crack that code." Coleman comes to BuzzFeed from Criteo, where he served as president for the ad tech firm, eventually leading the business to an IPO. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B07AA50DTF00> .

Food Fiiiiight

It appears that buying platform and DMP Turn and video ad platform TubeMogul are at war.  TubeMogul has published a retort to what it says are Turn’s claims in the marketplace. The page on Tubemogul.com begins as follows <http://go.adexchanger.com/I070UWD0L4P60A2q0F0BA00> : “Recently, TURN released a ‘fact sheet’ [link provided by TubeMogul <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0070VF0W7DP0L0A00> ] outlining why they believe their platform is ‘the superior choice to TubeMogul.’ While we welcome a little friendly competition, there is just one problem with Turn's claims: they are lies.” TubeMogul CEO Brett Wilson said in a tweet <http://go.adexchanger.com/i8FW00B7PWL00A000Dq2A04> Wednesday that it isn’t a war, “We're just responding to Turn's false and misleading info.” AdExchanger has reached out to Turn, but no response yet.

Setting The Bar

Innovation paves the way for adaptability and, ultimately, broadens the scope of what's attainable. This is the theme of Doug Weaver's weekly installment of The Drift. Weaver fascinatingly details the history of high jump as a metaphor to describe the modern marketing landscape. Before the invention of foam rubber, which Weaver explains is what’s now used to break a jumper's fall, high jumpers had a much different method of getting over the bar. For high jumpers in the early ’60s, foam rubber changed the game. "Real-time, data enabled marketing, programmatic audience buying, cheap and plentiful broadband access, social and sharing technologies," writes Weaver. "These are the foam rubber of our age."

Interactive Video Investment

Boulder, Colo.-based digital video startup Rapt Media has raised $3.1 million, TechCrunch reported Wednesday. The company's offerings are interactive and provide a customizable advertising platform, according to co-founder and CEO Erika Trautman. In fact, the co-founders are so keen to protect their tech’s place in the interactive digital video space that they've filed for five separate patents around their product. In other news, the company said it will use the recent funding to open new offices in New York and Los Angeles. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/iaFW00B7PYL00A000Dq2A04> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Hold The Phone

The industry is pouring on the mobile-first Kool-Aid with a heavy hand, but new data from Chartbeat suggests some healthy restraint. Mobile web traffic is not usurping desktop consumption, according to the analytics service – it's complementing it. Chartbeat found that mobile usage surges after 6 p.m., and surpasses desktop traffic through the evening until 9 a.m. "In general, it seems like each medium is strong while the others are weak,” said Chartbeat's chief data scientist, Josh Schwartz. “People are using phones while they wouldn’t be using desktops anyway." So, make new friends but keep the old? Read on at Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W071A0q0X0BAL0PDx2> .

Automating Native

For efficient native advertising, the question of scale remains. MediaPost reports that TripleLift is on a mission to unlock premium programmatic native advertising and the solution, as they see it, is computer vision rendering technology. Simply put, the tech offers a way to format brand content to match publisher sites automatically and in real time. It works by first scanning a publisher's site for format and design parameters, and applies those guidelines to native ad units. Advertisers are then given the option to adjust the look of the native content, to make it more or less camouflaged. This is, potentially, a way to weave native into the programmatic wave, according to MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00YWqA0007PxA02040D2L> . For a bit of comic relief on the native craze (if you missed it on Monday), watch John Oliver weigh in <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB0070Zx0W3DP0L0A00> .

Programmatic Service

Martin Kelly of UK-based Infectious Media says in an op-ed on Campaign Live that programmatic is unlocking new opportunity in the service layer of marketing and media. He writes, “The trade press is full of stories citing big brands who do not believe their agency can do the job required in programmatic, and with that comes opportunity to disrupt the agency landscape, just like search did ten years ago.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B00y7WP50A00> .

Creative Adds Video

On Tuesday, uStudio revealed a new partnership with creative and media agency R/GA. Through the partnership, uStudio will integrate its video platform into R/GA's Software Platform Lab, extending uStudio's video management tools to all R/GA clients. In a blog post debuting the partnership, uStudio explained, "With the overall usage of video growing rapidly, along with the expectation that video will deliver a high ROI, the technology used to manage all this video is as much of a strategic decision, if not more so, than the content itself." Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000y2170L0B06A4PDAq> .

Selling The Second Screen

Your Shazam app on your smartphone is broadening its appeal to media companies. Variety’s Todd Spangler reports that A+E Networks, AMC, Dick Clark Productions and Fuse will partner with the app platform to extend their second-screen initiatives. Spangler explains, “Shazam’s Resonate sales platform lets networks offer advertisers enhanced content in the app, such as media to drive brand intent and awareness, and partners also can use the app to drive network tune-in. In addition, Shazam can track users who have ID’d specific programming and can retarget those consumers after a show’s broadcast on Facebook and in the Shazam app.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4y070P00qD002LBW02A7>

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

YouTube’s Horizons

For Susan Wojcicki, the 15-year Google veteran who helped build the search company into a $55 billion advertising business, recreating the ad magic at YouTube will present some hurdles. Wojcicki took the lead at YouTube in February, and has since been buried under a sea of public recommendations on how to move YouTube's business model forward. One major headache for Wojcicki is the growing concern among creators over compensation – currently 45% of all ad revenue, according to a profile on Wojcicki by Fast Company.

Deep Learning’s Allure

Baidu, or "China's Google,” is investing heavily in deep learning, says The Next Web. In May, the search giant poached Google's AI researcher, Andrew Ng, a move that has deepened its data efforts, according to Baidu CEO Robin Li. During the company's Q2 earnings call, Li told analysts that deep learning spend is "already yielding near-term enhancements in user experience and customer ROI and is expected to drive transformational change over the longer term." Yu explained that image recognition based on deep learning will be a massive avenue for understanding users across devices.

Lord Speaks

Writing for Ad Age, AOL Platforms Global CEO Bob Lord offers a handful of observations on the current digital marketing ecosystem. "Having seen the waste inherent in our bloated publishing and advertising ecosystems first-hand, my take is that the industry's No. 1 objective should be to unify and simplify the technologies that automate the planning, buying, execution, optimization and measurement of cross-screen and cross-format campaigns," he writes. AOL strategy, no? Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0700pqSW> .

Brands Filter Into Instagram

Instagram is quickly catching up to Facebook's level of brand activity, according to social media shop Shareablee in an Adweek article. This may be impressive, considering Facebook launched in 2004 and Instagram is less than 4 years old. But rising brand engagement is to be expected for younger platforms as they transition into the digital space and marketers take note. According to Shareablee’s figures, a post on Instagram achieves three times the engagement rate than one on Facebook. But, there are challenges to Instagram.

Social Media Roadmap

On Monday, Re/code's Kurt Wagner looks into his crystal ball and prognosticates on the future of social channels. Messaging, video and atomization are key, according to Wagner. As sites like Facebook and Twitter grow to be massive communication hubs, the competition will heighten for mobile eyeballs. Private messaging, short-form videos and a great unbundling into standalone applications might all be in social's future. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWp47A00UL0PB0Y2> .
