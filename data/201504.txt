 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 


GroupM Chief On Rebates

At an ANA event in Phoenix this week, GroupM Chairman Irwin Gotlieb opened up about the kickback controversy, ignited by his former employee, ex-Mediacom CEO Jon Mandel. “Some clients are very distrustful of their agencies,” he said. “There are others who acknowledge they don't understand perhaps everything they should, and a little more visibility into things would be helpful.” But according to Gotlieb, GroupM has received very few pointed questions from clients on the topic, which, he added, “says as much about the clients – if not more – than it says about us, because there's a level of confidence about their ability to manage an agency that suggests that they're not paranoid."  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0UL0000tP02BAqDo0D40A> Ad Age has more.

Harmonizing Sales Channels

A white paper from Digital Content Next surveys the trade org’s members on the alignment of incentives between programmatic and high-touch sales, among other topics. Michael Stoeckel, who runs ad revenue operations for The New York Times, tells the authors, “We are empowering our direct sales team to be open to programmatic. We want to have all one-to-one deals go through the direct sales team, whether that is a dedicated programmatic budget or a programmatic line item within a larger media buy. There should be little to no difference between direct and programmatic deal terms, and both should be managed by the same people and be placed under the same scrutiny.” Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/FoDBL00EV0W0P2tq000AA04> 

Upfront Season, Now With Data

Broadcasters are coming armed to this year’s Upfronts with new analytics tools that mimic digital offerings,  <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0FoA00WtD0AP00040> the WSJ reports. Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting is debuting an offering called “Turner Audience Now,” and NBCUniversal is unveiling a similar product called “Audience Targeting Platform.” According to Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal’s president of ad sales, advertisers “no longer have to choose between data-driven opportunities that digital gives them and the power and scale of premium video that NBCUniversal gives them.” Other broadcast execs are attacking digital. Twentieth Television’s EVP of media sales, Michael Teicher, said, “The TV industry should be fighting back in unison to raise the flag on these flaws,” in reference to digital plagues like fraud and viewability.

What Mobile Means For Journalism

The Pew Research Center released its annual “State of the News Media” report on Wednesday, and this year, all eyes are on mobile.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/At0X04WB200AoPq00L0G0DA> According to the report, “39 of the top 50 digital news websites have more traffic to their sites and associated applications coming from mobile devices than from desktop computers.” Pew also cites mobile – and newer developments such as watches and other wearables – as having the potential to resurface audio journalism that’s been long stifled by the Internet and social media news distribution. Not only are podcast downloads up significantly (41% at NPR), but mobile is a boon to legacy radio networks too, which can now tap listeners outside of their cars.

Contract Issues Impact Neustar

Neustar’s earnings were darkened by the FCC-authorized contract negotiations that will likely end with rival Ericsson as the next Local Number Portability Administrator. This is a big deal for Neustar, as that contract, which it held for 18 years, made up 49% of its revenue. “We are obviously disappointed by the FCC’s action,” said CEO Lisa Hook during the call. Neustar’s revenues increased 9% YoY to $251.4 million, ahead of analysts’ $245.6 million estimate. Revenue from its Marketing Services division increased 13% YoY to $37.2 million. Additionally, the company managed to decrease its operating expenses 2% YoY to $171.9 million.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00o0Ht0WYDP0L0A00> Read the release.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Game On 

In a Tuesday blog post, Facebook debuted <http://go.adexchanger.com/llBqX000LoDP0A2A4000O0W>  new video functionality for app ads as it aims to drive more desktop game signups. “It’s eligible to play automatically in News Feed, there is a persistent call-to-action (CTA) over the video pop-up for ads … and all videos now have an end card that appears after they finish with options to replay it or install the game,” explained  Robby Banks, principal of monetization at Facebook. Game publisher Plamee is an early user of Facebook’s latest feature, and Michael Velkes, VP of marketing, is impressed. "The desktop app ad unit is the best converting non-incentive ad unit available in the industry,” he said. 

In Russia, R-TBD 

Yandex has completed the integration of ADFOX’s tech, which it acquired in  <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00Y0PL0lW00AD2q0oA04> September, into its ad network. The move further opens the Russian digital advertising market to RTB, which has lagged in comparison to global adoption. For Russian Internet companies like Yandex, a search engine, strict regulations regarding what’s displayed have hamstrung the adoption of advertising technology. But Yandex sees a silver lining. “According to first results, ADFOX’s partners … can now increase their revenue by up to 50% [since] its integration with YAN and RTB,” Vladimir Isaev, Yandex’s manager of international media relations, told Adexchanger in an email. Yandex also reported its quarterly earnings <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0l0P4qA02000WLQ0Z0AoDB>  on Tuesday, hitting investors’ expectations. 

Fashion Is In Style 

Refinery29 announced $50 million funding from WPP and Scripps Networks Interactive on Tuesday at a $300 million valuation, bringing the fashion and lifestyle publication’s total funding to $80 million. “We are focused on vastly expanding our media and entertainment brand, creating smart, provocative editorial, video, and social content at the intersection of style, culture, and independence,” said Refinery29 co-CEO Philippe von Borries in a statement. The investment comes after rumors of a high-valuation sale of PopSugar, as well as Conde Nast’s decision to turn Style.com, digital home of Vogue, into an ecommerce site. Fashionable women, it appears, have growing cachet in media and advertising. Read more at the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00lR0ALAWP0oB02q000> . 

Greasing The Skids 

PayPal debuted One Touch payment product for desktop and mobile websites on Tuesday, following up on last year’s launch of the same product for mobile apps. The technology isn’t new (Amazon offers a similar “1-Click” product), but Re/code reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00lS0ALAWP1oB02q000>  that the release “allows PayPal to beat Apple Pay in the transition from mobile apps to websites.” The product also marks a shift in mobile web publishers trying to regain market share from apps, who have dominated the platform (Google’s algo update nudges that  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0P2B00000Al4Dq02oWT0> along). And even for desktop browsing, PayPal hopes online retailers can up their conversion rates by removing the moment of friction when a user has to enter his or her payment details. 

Digital Video Is Hopping Paywalls 

As news organizations like The Wall Street Journal and New York Times invest more resources in digital video, it’s changing the way they design their websites and manage their paywalls. The WSJ, which gates non-subscribers, is making video free for all visitors. Digiday reporter Lucia Moses points out that “publishers like the Journal (estimated to charge CPMs in the range of $50 to $75) are incentivized to get as many views as possible.” As part of a redesign last week, the WSJ also changed its home page and search algorithms to surface more videos. WSJ senior executive producer Andy Regal affirms, “When it’s on your platform, you keep 100 percent of the revenue.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00lU0ALAWP3oB02q000> .

Give A Brand A Cookie... 

In the wake of the FCC’s ruling on net neutrality, which redefined how consumer data can be collected and used, mobile carriers are in a state of flux. Verizon took a beating <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWl4oA005L0PB0W2>  in January for its perma-cookie, which enabled advertisers and third parties to track users who cleared cookies or even opted out of the program, but the issue of inadequate audience data is a problem that still plagues mobile. According to Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PX40l0D6Aoq2> , “Mobile is a medium that provides access for a fee, much like cable or magazines. Carriers should take advantage of that opportunity, do it right and become … the guardians of sensitive subscriber data.” Or, carriers can take a page out of Facebook and Google’s playbooks, and offer the chance to match brands’ data with their audience data.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic Smoke Screen 

Programmatic trading helped boost holding companies’ organic growth rates in Q1, the WSJ  <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP0000ZL0dW00AD2q0oA04> reports, but inconsistencies in reporting methods are causing confusion in the market. While some firms account for revenues and profits earned from reselling inventory to clients, others do not. “None of our competitors to date have given a revenue number and a net sales number,” said WPP chief Martin Sorrell during an earnings call last week. “We find that immensely puzzling.” Meanwhile, IPG’s leadership continues to affirm its agnostic approach. The discrepancies are confusing investors, according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. “For the better part of the last year and a half, direct comparisons between agencies have been difficult to make,” he said. “You have to make a subjective interpretation of what’s going on. Investors are confused. … What was peer-level growth? You can’t define it.” 

Dominating Social Logins 

This may come as no shock, but Facebook is king of social logins, owning 63% to 72% of the market, depending on who you ask. According to Gigya, Facebook grew its share of logins in Q1 2015 to 63% of the total market, whereas data from LoginRadius puts Facebook’s share closer to 72% in 2015’s first quarter. Social login data is the holy grail of advertising, according to eMarketer, who predicts that global social network users will swell to 2 billion this year. EMarketer adds that “[f]ully 62.4% of social networkers globally will use Facebook in 2015, and 70.1% of Facebook’s user base will access the site on mobile phones.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bo002W2A000040eB0D0LPqA> . 

Digital Upfront Boom 

This year’s digital content NewFronts are hitting a historic high, the NYT reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000e21o0L0B03A4PDAq> , with 33 events scheduled in NYC over the next two weeks. The voluminous growth reflects a mad dash to capitalize on digital video buying, as it gradually siphons off a portion of traditional TV budgets. TV raked in $68.5 billion in ad spend last year, while digital video advertising grew to $5.8 billion in the US and is projected to grow to $12.8 billion by 2018. “This is really reacting to not where the world is going but where the world is,” said Dermot McCormack, president of video at AOL. Programmatic is also playing a role, according to Starcom US President Amanda Richman. “The impact of programmatic is definitely being felt across budgets that might have been invested during the upfronts, as more marketers move to real-time decisions about where they want to spend,” she said. 

Sprint To The Wrist 

As app developers and brands race to nail down marketing plans for the Apple Watch, Kochava is the first firm to support app analytics and mobile campaign tracking. The mobile attribution company is integrated with more than 1,200 publishers and networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Google and Pandora, and offers real-time visualization of campaign data. “As the Apple Watch, and other wearables, becomes an essential part of customers’ lives, measuring app activity and understanding performance is crucial,” said Kochava CEO Charles Manning. “This is going to be huge for advertisers and is just the beginning for what is sure to be an explosive wearables market.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/qoAW0A0DL4004e02B0P200q> . 

America’s Pastime Meets The Future 

Stadiums and venues are starting to incorporate DOOH platforms and beacons into their revenue strategies. Ad Age takes a look <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0e0P4qA02000WL3050AoDB>  at the Mets’ six-year-old Citi Field, where the team is embracing marketing tech to fill sponsorships gaps. “‘We're trying to get the Burger Kings and the McDonald's to think of us as more digital,’ said Wes Engram, VP-corporate sponsorships for the Mets. The team is encouraged by new digital signage, which raises 300% more revenue than static billboards. The Mets are also increasing their in-stadium beacons from 20 to 60, enabling more sponsors to deliver messages to fans during the game.

Diversifying Digital Video 

Snapchat is pushing advertisers to embrace videos that use a vertical aspect ratio, and minor as that may sound, Adweek points out <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ae0704WB200AoPq00L050DA>  that it’s a legitimate concern. “It's no small challenge,” writes Adweek reporter Garett Sloane. “Snapchat, even with 100 million-plus users, has to teach [brands] how to create ads from this new vantage point.” And it’s not just Snapchat – popular streaming platforms like Periscope and Meerkat also rely on vertical video. Facebook’s digital video boom led to a rise in silent video, as their autoplay ads don’t autoplay sound, and it seems like other platforms are similarly pushing advertisers to fit their medium. 

Visualizing Viral 

BuzzFeed publisher Dao Nguyen introduced what the company is calling Pound (Process for Optimizing and Understanding Network Diffusion) as a new kind of metric for online content. According to Nguyen, “Traditional web analytics are fundamentally unable to capture what actually happens on the social web today; they obliterate its inherent tree structure.” Pound replaces the “tree structure” model for the sharing of viral content in favor of a broader vision across networks – a forest, as opposed to a single tree. BuzzFeed also said that users share sponsored content the same way they do for editorial (though it’s worth noting that viral sponsored content happens to be BuzzFeed’s bread and butter).

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook-YouTube Showdown 

Facebook Video is gaining speed, but YouTube has more inventory and offers advertisers more options. The WSJ polls buyers <http://go.adexchanger.com/DW840050ABD0090oL02P0Aq> , who are impressed with Facebook’s video reach but aren’t fully sold. “The growth of video views on Facebook is staggering,” said Digitas CIO Adam Shlachter. “But it’s still not 100% clear what the opportunities are to capitalize on that.” Though YouTube is not a perfect platform and has struggled to reach profitability, industry execs don’t yet expect Facebook to steal its advertisers quite yet. “There is a huge opportunity for Facebook to grab video ad dollars because of its targeting,” said Brian Shin, Visible Measures’ CEO, “But we don’t see those dollars coming from YouTube.” Time will tell how Facebook’s latest branded content initiative, dubbed Anthology, alters the competition. 

The Case For ‘Platishers’ 

Speaking to Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00990ALAWP6oB02q000> , Hearst Magazine’s president of digital media, Troy Young, says modern publishers must build platforms if they mean to survive in a digital world. “Platforms are incredibly strategic to the future of multibrand media companies,” Young said. “If you do not have a platform and data strategy that brings the scale and power of brands together as an organization, scale will only get in the way against pure-play, very focused competitors.” As proof, Young pointed to the success of young publishers like BuzzFeed and Vox – both of whom have deep-seated technological competency coupled with strong ad offerings. But according to Young, there’s still room for display. “Display media is really important to augment what you’re doing with content,” he said. “What display gives you is frequency. It gives you a systematic ability to deliver a message.” 

App O’Clock 

TechCrunch took an early look at the Apple Watch’s app ecosystem, which could reach some 20 million consumers in 2015, according to some estimates. Data from app store analytics firm App Annie suggests the watch is launching with 3,061 apps, many of which were designed specifically for Apple’s shiny new wearable. “The majority of Watch apps are the result of developers who extended their existing iOS applications to include Watch support,” explains TechCrunch reporter Sarah Perez <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00aWqA000oP9A07040D2L> , “but App Annie tracked 889 apps – or 29% of the total sample – built just for the Watch.” Separately, Ad Age  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0P8B00000A94Dq02oWb0> reported Friday that the Apple Watch still lacks enough scale to sell ads, but marketers may find other ways to leverage the wearable.

Three years ago, Twitter rolled out self-serve ads for SMBs in the US, and on Friday Adweek followed up with data from BIA/Kelsey on the initiative’s progress. The local-media-focused firm surveyed 600 companies in the US that have between 10 and 99 employees and found that 9.5% had bought an ad on Twitter. According to the data, half those SMBs bought Twitter’s Promoted Tweet offering, and another 18.3% of respondents confirmed they used the social platform for Marketing. BIA/Kelsey said that the total average advertising budget for the surveyed companies hit $35,693, and that 21.4% of that sum got funneled into social platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Looking ahead, 61% of respondents told BIA/Kelsey that social was an extremely high priority in terms of spending priorities for the coming year.

Power Of The Purse 

Amid a period of tense introspection among brands and agencies regarding their digital advertising, the 4A’s and ANA announced the formation of a transparency task force on Friday. MediaPost reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/l9Bqa000LoDP0A2A4000d0W>  that the task force, comprised of the groups’ chiefs, as well as leading agencies and marketers, is tasked with taking “decisive action to address concerns about media transparency.” Though digital has established itself as a core part of marketing budgets and continues to eat into TV ad spend, marketers are pushing back across the board on the ecosystem’s opacity.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Nomi’s Opt-Out Settlement 

The FTC’s investigation into little-known mobile tracking firm Nomi for its 2013 practices could drag beacons and other mobile listening tech onto the hot seat. The FTC claims Nomi misled consumers by claiming mobile users had the option to opt out of tracking without ever making an opt-out tool available, meanwhile gathering data from 9 million consumers’ mobile devices in the first nine months of 2013. While many beacon and mobile-tracking firms insist their tech hashes all data gathered, Ad Age notes <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PnP00q240Y> , “The FTC appears to be less concerned with the nuances of how these technologies work and which types of device identifiers should be considered personally identifiable and more focused on the ability to tie a device to a person.” 

Brands Giveth... 

P&G hopes to save $500 million by pruning the number of agencies it uses for advertising, media, public relations, package design and development of in-store materials. The announcement came from CFO Jon Moeller on the company’s Thursday earnings call, as reported by the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DnBqA0020P0W5AYQ00> . The cutbacks come not long after the world’s three largest advertisers, L’Oreal, Unilever and P&G, all announced agency reviews. Ad Age also reports Thursday <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PRB6D000qA2Y04L0n>  that “Coca-Cola Co. has put its US media-buying and -planning business into review.” Though likely less dire than it seems, it certainly adds to a dramatic upfront/NewFront season. 

Hear Ye, Hear Ye! 

WPP’s Xaxis partnered with media & entertainment group Global on Thursday to launch Xaxis Audio, a programmatic product for audio ads. The product rolls together Global’s Digital Audio Exchange (Dax) and Xaxis’ data-management platform Turbine, letting advertisers target audiences from more than 70 publishers (among them Audioboom, Blinkbox, Jango and Rdio). “More people than ever are listening to audio, and there’s been a big increase in people listening on digital devices,” said Mike Gordon, COO at Global. “To address this, we created Dax, which provides advertisers with access to … music streaming platforms, digital radio brands and audio social networks in one single buy.” The partnership will launch on Thursday. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0nSA0000q0D720LAWY> . 

Battling The Bots 

DoubleVerify debuted enhancements to its digital video solution on Thursday to improve the speed and accuracy of bot detection. Specifically, the enhancements tackle sophisticated bots that mask their identity days after they’re first detected. Video ad platform Tremor was the first to upgrade to DoubleVerify’s offering, and the firm is seeing results. “While individual campaign results may vary, in our first month of using the new implementation of DV bot fraud detection, their post-buy data shows that we're already seeing less than 1% bot traffic across all managed and self-service campaigns – including our DSP – of desktop video inventory,” said David Cooper, Tremor’s director of network quality. “This is promising in our effort to create the highest-quality environments for our partners." Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq08nA00TYD0AP00040> . 

Always Optimizing 

Brands still don’t feel comfortable with the quantifiable returns on their digital marketing dollars. At least that’s the account given by Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0Y0P4qA02000WL90U0AnDB> , which cites a variety of marketers who are eager to be more involved but wish they knew where to focus their resources. For instance, many brands are “hot on investing in content production, but [lack] the tools to measure whether this investment [is] translating into actual sales.” Another concern is how to internally structure marketing teams, which is something attribution vendors have also faced when looking to adjust brands’ digital practices. On the up side, the marketers aren’t concerned about whether to jump in, but “how to capitalize on all the opportunities in front of us.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Digital Spend Inches Closer To TV 

The IAB released its Internet ad revenue report <http://go.adexchanger.com/FnDBL00n20W0P2Sq000AA04>  on Wednesday, revealing that digital ad spend grew 16% YoY in 2014 to total $49.5 billion. Compare that to broadcast and cable TV spend, which totaled $65.7 billion combined last year. Mobile drove digital growth, increasing 76% YoY, from $7.1 billion in 2013 to $12.5 billion last year. With next week’s NewFronts on deck, advertisers should note that online video grew 17% YoY to total $3.3 billion. Display ads grew less, up 5%, but totaled a sizable $13.5 billion in 2014. “A prominent rise in social [media], a significant mobile activity, is driving growth in advertising revenue as consumers spend more time connected,” said David Silverman, a partner at PwC. Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40o0A2S0B3LD0WnP00q0A0>  

Kraft’s Road Map 

Speaking to iMedia Connection <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0n40B4L0p2AAP00q0DS00> , Kraft Food’s VP of media, data and CRM, Bob Rupczynski, said the CPG firm’s future is addressability, not programmatic. “We look at the future of media as addressability,” Rupczynski said. For Kraft, he added “It’s about understanding consumers at a deep level not just collecting data [and] not just having stockpiles of information about consumers, but understanding consumers, understanding what makes them tick and then being able to address them with the right content in the right moment.” Know thy customer. 

Google Does Outbrain 

Google debuted a free content recommendation tool that lets AdSense publishers promote their own content on their web pages. Google says the tool, dubbed Matched content, will help publishers promote relative articles to users while also increasing visitors’ time spent on and engagement with content. According to Google’s blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0SWD0L5000B4000nq> , “This new feature can help you increase your site's page views and ad impressions, and could increase your ad revenue by making it easy for your visitors to find your content.” Watch out, Taboola and Outbrain. 

Tech Firms On The Hill 

Tech firms are ramping up their lobbying spend and (no surprise) Google is the biggest spender, with $5.5 million “invested” this quarter. Google has steadily increased its lobbying spend since mid-2011, and “has spent on average at least a million dollars each month in areas both central to its business, such as online advertising and security, and tangential to it, such as international tax reform and drone technology,” according to Techworld <http://go.adexchanger.com/ur0000DB4L0A0602SPqWAn0> . Apple spent $1.2 million in 2015’s first quarter, a jump on its 4Q14 $1.2 million DC bill. Amazon also increased its Washington budget by 14%, spending $1.91 million in Q1. Meanwhile, Facebook cut its lobbying budget by 12% to $2.4 million, and Microsoft’s budget dipped 9% to $1.9 million. 

Mobile Video Showing Promise 

Take this with grain of salt: YouTube cites joint research with Ipsos MediaCT that claims viewers are 1.4 times more likely to watch ads on mobile devices than on PCs or TVs, and 1.8 times more likely to share videos on mobile. As Re/code’s Peter Kafka <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0s702q0L0AB0Dn00AS4>  points out, this is “not a coincidence: The world’s biggest video player now generates more than half of its traffic from mobile.” But while the problems are apparent – “Ads are the things keeping you away from the stuff you actually want to see” – platforms are eager to seize any data that helps them bridge the gap between rising mobile traffic and lagging mobile ad revenue.

Shrinking The Black Box 

Ad firms, and the demand side of the exchange world in general, might start to feel a squeeze from agency partners. The number of vendors servicing agencies has risen dramatically in recent years, but a variety of market pressures may consolidate that space. “Agency executives say it’s growing increasingly complicated and unnecessary to manage that many relationships, and they are now attempting to streamline the number of digital ad partners they work with,” reports The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DnBqA0020P0WuAS900> . Agencies have long been uncomfortable with the opacity of the programmatic marketplace, and vendors now face powerhouses like Google, Facebook and AOL offering full-service advertising solutions.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google Flexes Its Algorithm 

On Tuesday, Google updated its algorithm to incorporate a site’s “mobile-friendliness” into search result prominence. “This change will affect mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a significant impact in our search results,” Google explained in a February blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0uKnWP10A00>  announcing the update. Wired reporter Cade Metz called the adjustment “likely the biggest change of the past three years ... By improving the state of the mobile web, Google makes its mobile search engine more attractive. In doing so, it makes more money.” The move may scare some publishers, but it’s a worthy reminder that it’s Google’s world, and they’re just playing in it. Read on. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00n0vK0W2DP0L0A00>  Also, check out AdExchanger’s earlier coverage <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0n0wWD0L4P30A2q0K0BA00>  of media companies’ reactions to the looming change. 

Ad Blocking Upheld 

A court in Hamburg, Germany, struck down a four-month-old lawsuit against Adblock Plus on Tuesday. The plaintiffs, German publishers Zeit Online GmbH and Handelsblatt GmbH, argued Adblock Plus’ software is illegal. “Adblock Plus will continue to provide users with a tool that helps them control their Internet experience,” Adblock Plus wrote in an emailed statement following the verdict. “At the same time, we will endeavor to work with publishers, advertisers and content creators to encourage nonintrusive ads, discover new ways to make ads better and push forward to a more sustainable Internet ecosystem.” Read the Adblock Plus blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40x0A2K0B4LD0WnP00q0A0> , in which the company calls on the industry to work with Adblock Plus to develop new forms of ads “that are actually useful and welcomed by users.” 

Disrupting The Branding Survey 

Knotch, a start-up with $4 million in fresh funding, wants to bring new methods to measuring the impact of brand-produced digital content. Founder Anda Gansca sees an opportunity in user surveys. “Brands are working so hard to get their audiences to love their content, and so much of this stuff now is in editorial environments, and we end up shoving something [like a survey] in their face,” Gansca told the WSJ. <http://go.adexchanger.com/T50WK0P0n000DBy20L4qAA0>  Instead, Knotch’s tech serves an image that prompts ratings on a negative-positive scale when a user hovers over it. The technology isn’t revolutionary, but with the amount of money “flying blind” in the sponsored and branded content realm, there’s a lot of value in demonstrating ROC (return on content). 

Autoplay Weathers Early Storms 

Facebook’s decision to embrace autoplay video ads increasingly seems like an industry standard, as Twitter, Instagram, Vine and other publishers echo the change. After early vitriol from commenters and bloggers toward autoplay, eMarketer’s Paul Verna is “surprised there hasn’t been more of a backlash.” While users aren’t fond of autoplay videos, and its adoption has led to an increase in the deployment of ad blocking technology, the demonstrable video views they bring to marketers and publishers is apparently worth the audience irritation. Read on via Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0KWD0L6000B4000nz> . 

Twitter Commerce Flies The Nest 

Months after the launch of Twitter’s ecommerce initiative, ticket-sellers have started to partner with the platform to drive sales. Most recently, the Atlanta Hawks tapped Twitter to sell tickets to the team’s playoff games. Re/code points out <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB7000AKn0A200WL4qPA00>  that former Ticketmaster CEO Nathan Hubbard is now Twitter’s head of commerce and also cites an anonymous source who claims, “Twitter currently doesn’t take a cut of ticket sales, though it seems plausible it could in the future.” Twitter has a ways to go before the product’s solidly in place, or before it even knows if users will respond positively to open commerce on the platform. But the potential for a “Buy” button placed directly on a tweet is an alluring end game.

Cars.com Sees Big Mobile Opportunity 

Many publishers struggle to monetize mobile, but not Cars.com. “A car dealer doesn’t really care if their lead comes from the mobile application or if it comes from the desktop,” said Jack Williams, president of Gannett Digital Ventures, during Gannett’s Q1 earnings call. “We found it’s really very close to the bottom of the sales funnel,” added CEO Gracia Martore <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0CK0Ln0DB090W0q4P20A0A> . Gannett acquired Cars.com in October and reported that the site increased digital revenues by 28%. Seeking Alpha transcript here <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00KA0L0DD00nB2qW0AaP04> . In related news, Gannett announced that its spinoff of its broadcasting and digital division (including Cars.com) will be called TEGNA.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Snapchat Advertisers Demand Granularity 

Advertisers are clamoring for more info on Snapchat’s audience, according to a report in The Information. Today, Snapchat provides estimates on how many people engage with its “Live Story” videos. (CEO Evan Spiegel recently tweeted that a Coachella Live Story drew more than 40 million views.) It adds to that analytics on unique page views, percentage views by duration and how many people saw a branded snap within a Live Story. But that’s not granular enough, according to the buyers paying Snapchat’s steep $750,000 asking price. The ephemeral messaging firm will have to dole out more nuanced audience data if it aims to retain and please its advertising partners.

Facebook Exclusives 

As Facebook vies to host more content for publishers directly, it may also be on the hunt for video. Adweek publisher sources say the social network has been “aggressively” asking for exclusivity, placing it into more direct competition with YouTube. Though Facebook has only done a limited number of video ad deals to date, its targeting capabilities are attracting marketer interest – it can target viewers with up to 94% accuracy based on age, gender and location. But YouTube remains the leading platform for driving overall video views, according to Kevin Cronin, chief of social and search at Universal McCann. Read on. <http://go.adexchanger.com/AC0h04WB200AnPq00L0S0DA>  

Netflix Vs. HBO 

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings doesn’t mince words when it comes to traditional TV. “We’ve had 80 years of linear TV, and it’s been amazing, and in its day the fax machine was amazing,” he said. According to the New York Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0ni0B4L0T2AAP00q0DC00> , Hastings thinks Netflix’s original content production will give HBO a run for its money. “[HBO] hasn’t really had a challenge for a long time, and now they do,” he said. “It’s going to spur us both on to incredible work.” Meanwhile, linear TV executives are quietly considering limiting the programming they provide to Netflix, as the platform transforms from partner to competitor. Netflix added a record 4.9 million paid users in Q1 2015, bringing the global total to a little under 60 million. 

Upfront-ocalypse 

In what Ad Age is calling <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0C0P4qA02000WLU0j0AnDB>  an “upfront Armageddon,” broadcasters fear that after decades of advertising growth, brands will follow through on “veiled or direct threats to shift money from TV to digital.” Broadcasters point to viewability, fraud and ROI that plague online, with CBS CRO David Poltrack calling digital migration “a really dangerous thing to do.” What’s more, the world’s three largest advertisers – P&G, Unilever and L’Oréal – have either recently put their agencies up for review or are rumored to be considering doing so. 

Mobile Websites Fight For Eyeballs 

Many websites have been boxed out of mobile by apps. But Google is tackling the problem head-on. TechCrunch reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/UqkP04A0LB0WAC02n0000VD>  that the company’s most recent version of Chrome “will support the new web standard <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00WWqA000nPCA0l040D2L>  for push notifications on Android and the desktop, which means websites will be able to push updates to users just like mobile apps do.” Pinterest, eBay and VICE News are among the first to do so. The technology, however, is still unpolished, and it will likely be many moons before apps lose any ground to the mobile web.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

LiveRail On The Ecosystem 

In a Friday Q <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBS000Awn0A200WL4qPz00> &A with Business Insider, LiveRail’s international chief, Yoan Arnstein, opens up about Facebook’s push into native and the recently filed patent that suggests Facebook is working on a content exchange. “Publishers are really excited about the world of consumption and how it's moving to discovery,” he said. “Taboola and Outbrain are getting a lot of traction. But I don’t necessarily think that people are thinking about them first and foremost in terms of monetization. In the realm of LiveRail, we want to focus on how we can best help publishers monetize their inventory.” When asked if Facebook is considering consolidating its ad tech (à la ONE By AOL), Arnstein was vague about LiveRail’s and Atlas’ future. “At this point in time, we are really happy with the current positioning, and we feel it makes sense for what we’re trying to do in the market,” he said. 

Europe Vs. Google & Facebook 

Facebook and Google are meeting stiff resistance from both European regulators and European consumers, which will slow the growth of digital and social media advertising on the continent. The issue is twofold, as identified by Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBT000Awn0A200WL4qPA00>  – more intense regulation and consumer privacy laws means the two companies can’t collect the rich user data they’ve mined in the US and other locales, and “the less data they can accumulate...the less finely tuned – and less valuable – their ads are.” European Internet users are also substantially more likely to deploy ad blocking software, which act as “a shield against Facebook, Twitter or Google's retargeting plans.” The combined effect is a continent rife with landmines for consumer data collectors and advertisers. 

Fluid Native Metrics 

A recent ANA survey offers a glimpse of the native ad metrics that matter most to marketers. Respondents said brand lift and awareness, click-throughs, social media sharing rates, time spent, purchase intent and lead generation are all key. The ANA’s Bill Duggan tells The Journal’s Jack Marshall, “For all the buzz around native advertising, you don’t hear a lot about measurement and ROI,” he said. “The industry would benefit from a deeper understanding of the metrics that matter most for native.” With or without standardization, eMarketer predictions US native ad spend will swell 34% in 2015 to reach $4.3 billion. More. <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0UL0000wP02BAqDn0B40A>  

What’s Old Is New 

Chevy is running a digital video in the printed May issues of Esquire and Popular Mechanics, both of which are published by Hearst. Not all readers will receive a copy with the video, as Hearst mined its internal data to identify “some 10,000 subscribers each to Esquire and Popular Mechanics – those considered likely Colorado buyers – [to receive] a video player embedded inside the print page.” Ad Age reports that <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0n0CWD0L4PV0A2q0w0BA00>  Americhip, the company that provides the technology to embed digital video in print, ran a similar campaign for CBS in Entertainment Weekly in 2009. The print-embed strategy will likely continue as an occasional one-off campaign. 

Vessel Raises 

Online video startup Vessel closed a $57.5 million round led by Institutional Venture Partners, The Guardian reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0w0P4qA02000WLD0W0AnDB> . Vessel is the brainchild of former Hulu executives Jason Kilar and Richard Tom. It’s early days, but Vessel has already laid the pipework to serve targeted ads on its platform. “We collect some information automatically when you interact with our Services, and we may also keep track of your activity across multiple websites,” reads Vessel’s privacy policy <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0nAAX0DEw00> . “We keep track of your interaction with content and advertisements so we can make content recommendations to you and serve you ads for things we think you’re actually interested in.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Hitting A Mobile Target 

Rubicon Project and xAd are combining their capabilities to bring scale and precision to programmatic mobile advertising. xAd claims it “verifies location data signals for accuracy and validates the physical location of the signal,” within 80 milliseconds. Dan Hight, xAd’s head of platform, sees an opportunity to tap “a new roster of premium advertisers via Rubicon Project’s private marketplace platform.” The two companies will embark on a joint roadshow to pitch their combined capabilities to agencies and trading desks. The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq09nA00lpD0AP00040> . 

24-Hour Tumble 

Tumblr debuted a new ad product on Thursday, dubbed Sponsored Day, that lets brands place an ad at the top of a user’s dashboard for 24 hours. Nike is the first brand to trial the unit, and Tumblr says other clients are on deck to follow in the coming days. Sponsored Day is Tumblr’s second ad unit (after Sponsored Radar) and follows its recent ad products, Creator’s Network and Sponsored Video. Tumblr’s head of creative strategy, David Hayes, tells Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0ap0Ln0DB0m0W0q4P20A0A> , “The brand can also curate a whole bunch of content from the community. In [Nike's] case of women's fitness, the content can come from the community or the brand's own blog.” Tumblr now reaches 460 million consumers worldwide and will price the new product on a CPM basis. 

‘In A Relationship’ Or ‘It’s Complicated’? 

Yahoo and Microsoft have agreed to amend their existing partnership, which was formed in 2009 by the predecessors of both current CEOs. The agreement will provide Yahoo with “increased flexibility to enhance the search experience on any platform,” and “Microsoft will become the exclusive sales force for ads delivered by Microsoft’s Bing Ads platform.” The agreement gives Yahoo more latitude with its search ad results, though Microsoft will still represent the ads for a majority of user traffic on desktop. The change also means Microsoft can further integrate its sales and engineering teams. The underlying economic structure, with Microsoft sharing revenue from ads directed via Yahoo searches, will remain in place. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0pA0DB0Wb2Lq00nA00n4P0> . 

Breaking Print’s Revenue Dams 

The American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME), a magazine trade group, has once again revised its standards to adapt to digital media. In recent years, ASME loosened restrictions on what qualifies as a magazine, a move that showed more deference to publications that focus on the digital world. Ad Age notes <http://go.adexchanger.com/To0Wp0P0n000DBc20L4qAA0>  two major new changes. First, “Discouraging cover ads [used to be] the first item on the list; now there's no specific language dissuading publishers from selling cover ads.” Second, the association, known for its strict editorial standards, is now allowing editors to work on sponsored material, just not for companies they report on. In a fight for its life, the print publishing world is loosening up its standards to squeeze out more of that precious, precious revenue. 

Twitter Spreading Its Wings 

Twitter revealed its redesigned homepage on Thursday. The new look is chock full of content, almost like an online magazine. The move is in line with Twitter’s goals of convincing non-users who view tweets to sign up, as well as to provide more documentable eyeballs for advertising. The move comes as Twitter tries to assign value to “the many millions of people who visit every month who don’t log in,” according to a company blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pd40p0DpAnq2> . Twitter also recently finalized a deal with Google <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PqB00000Ap4Dq02nWe0>  that aims to extend the social platform’s reach and increase its advertising real estate. Faced with audience growth concerns, Twitter’s trying to prove it can offer value beyond its user base.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Splashy Programmatic 

Programmatic is slowly seeping into other digital formats, Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0kA0DB0Wu2Lq00nA00B4P0> . Automation is already a mainstay for display ads, but splashier units like homepage takeovers and pushdowns are attracting ad dollars. Undertone, the ad network behind these alternative units (currently running on sites owned by Gannett, American Media, USA Today Sports, Accuweather and Bonnier Corporation, to name a few), is moving the first iteration of these formats through programmatic direct deals, which will run across Undertone’s full network of publishers. But there’s a catch: Brands can’t select individual publishers for the placements. 

Google To Link Ads And Email 

The WSJ reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0n00kqCv>  that Google is in talks to hand off consumer email addresses to marketers for targeted advertising. If that rings a bell, it’s because Facebook did the same thing in 2012 for its CRM matching program Custom Audiences. According to two people familiar with the negotiations, Google could unleash the new ad product later this year or in early 2016. The ads would initially be limited to search results and wouldn’t apply to digital display spots. The Journal’s Rolfe Winkler and Jack Marshall explain that this could help marketers reach consumers when they’re actually shopping. “The data could also help both Google and advertisers better understand the relationship between online ads and consumers’ real-world activities and purchases,” they write. 

Buying Into Email 

Apparently, email’s on everyone’s hit list. On Wednesday, Israeli digital marketing firm Matomy took a 70% stake in Canadian email marketing provider Avenlo. The deal, which transacted for an undisclosed sum, follows Matomy’s MobFox acquisition in October. With MobFox, Matomy got a mobile programmatic platform, and with Avenlo, it aims to bolster its data-driven email and targeting capabilities. "Data is a crucial element in performance-based advertising, and the data capabilities that Avenlo provides will assist Matomy across all of our media channels,” said Matomy CEO Ofer Druker. If Matomy decides to purchase the remaining 30% of the company, it has the next three years to do so. The Drum has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PDB00000Ak4Dq02nWw0> . 

Yahoo And Foursquare: Will They Or Won’t They? 

Sources tell TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/hLPnx4B00W000qAk0020AED>  that Yahoo is in talks to buy Foursquare, though Re/code’s sources <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWk4nA00FL0PB0y2>  were quick to debunk the rumor. TechCrunch slapped a $900 million price tag on the alleged acquisition, pointing out that the buy would strengthen Yahoo’s search efforts and boost its mobile portfolio of apps and location data. An anonymous source tells TechCrunch that the “deal is done,” but Re/code’s anonymous sources said the rumor isn’t true. The chatter follows this week’s launch of Foursquare's Pinpont <http://go.adexchanger.com/ynkWDqP00A0LABz04G00020> , a location-based ad network. 

Mobile Native Rising 

Marketers are pouring a larger portion of their ad budgets into mobile native ads, according to eMarketer <http://go.adexchanger.com/qnAW0A0DLH004k02B0PA00q> , and they’re seeing high engagement rates in return. InMobi polled marketers around the globe and, though mobile native ad usage remained relatively low, 57% of respondents said they had plans to tap into the format, and a majority of marketers said they’d increase their mobile native ad budgets by 25% or more by 2017. Research from Polar in October 2014 also suggests that click-through rates for native ads are higher on mobile in the US and the UK than on desktop (0.27% on mobile devices vs. 0.15% on desktop).

Advertisers Kick Tires For Twitch 

Twitch, Amazon’s live-streaming video platform, is courting a broader set of advertisers and premium publishers, among those P&G and Discovery Digital Networks. But it might not be an easy sell for all advertisers. “Most brands will tell you this demographic is very slippery and hard to keep,” said Imari Oliver, VP at Omnicom agency Sparks & Honey, though he added that Twitch “is hitting a lot of sweet spots for brands.” Twitch will need to demonstrate ROI and audience retention if it hopes to reel in more ad spend. Digiday has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWC400J0ABD00k0nL02P0Aq> . 

Mobile Programmatic Partners 

Are more brand dollars on their merry mobile way? AudienceScience – P&G's programmatic buying platform of choice – announced Thursday that it'll be partnering with Millennial Media to give its advertisers access to mobile inventory on the Millennial Media Exchange. According to recent research from MoPub, there was a 52% uptick in exchange-based mobile programmatic advertising spend at the end of 2014, largely driven by big brands. “We're working to make programmatic buying – and mobile advertising – simple for our partners,” Mark Connon, EVP of platform business at Millennial Media, told AdExchanger.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

See No Native 

When GroupM and Condé Nast announced that the former’s clients would only pay for 100% viewable ads, a lot of people were stunned. But the decision is less radical than it initially appeared. Speaking at Ad Age’s Digital Conference in New York, Condé Nast’s SVP of digital sales, Lisa Valentino, clarified that native ads don’t count. “If one of [GroupM's] clients is doing a huge sponsorship on one of our sites, it may not be 100% in view," she said. "That's not the intention of this relationship." But GroupM’s chief digital officer, Rob Norman, added that 100% viewability is possible. “The publisher community and agency community will coalesce around a very high bar for viewability,” he said, “and it will happen very quickly." Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00n0jf0WlDP0L0A00> . Elsewhere, Condé Nast reported <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000m2040qAnLPDBfk0WA0>  its “best quarter ever” for digital audience growth, which rose 56% YoY to total 76.7 million adults per month on average. 

Facebook Frequency Caps 

"Very few companies have the ability to target user demographics with the accuracy that Facebook has,” James Curran, CEO of ad tech firm STAQ, tells CNBC <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tn0Wf0P0n000DBl20L4qAA0> . “I think that they are just going to be ahead of the pack for a long time." Facebook’s got all the demographic and behavioral data to target cross-device, but its ad frequency caps continue to irritate advertisers. "A lot of advertisers want maximum reach," added Laura Martin, an entertainment and Internet analyst at Needham & Co. "Mark is basically saying … he wants to have higher-priced ads to more targeted segments, so that he can both grow his top line – or even keep it the same – but have fewer ads served." 

OTT Relearning Linear Tricks 

Sony’s digital video service Crackle is debuting more than just new programming at this week’s upfront event. Crackle will change its viewer interface, the WSJ reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bn00oW2A000040fB0DmLPqA> . Videos will autoplay, and “the company will now stream video constantly in a linear fashion. Depending on when a person logs onto the app, a different show or movie will be playing.” As part of that constant stream, Crackle is prioritizing growing its ad biz. “Give us your 30-second spots, and you can feel good about them being watched,” said Eric Berger, EVP of digital networks for Sony Pictures Television and general manager of Crackle. “We have elegant ad solutions and no issues with viewability,” he added. 

Ad Fraud Still A Plague 

Over a third of web traffic is estimated to be fraudulent, which is an ongoing headache for publishers and advertisers. Digiday publishes a roundup <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqpB0n2LW004D0P0AAn0f00>  of major European news outlets and ad-buying execs’ thoughts on fraud. BBC Worldwide SVP Tom Bowman says ridding the industry of fraud is akin to “getting rid of malaria.” RTE Digital’s commercial director, Connor Mullen, adds, “It’s a bit like chasing drug cheats: They’re always a couple steps ahead.” Collectively, the media buyers and ad tech providers that were interviewed see new metrics taking over to replace CPMs, which they say incentivizes fraud. 

Second-Generation Native 

When native advertising first rolled around, some publishers worried about preserving editorial integrity. But as readers continue to be nonplussed by the addition of sponsored content to their media diet, more are saying that native is here to stay and will continue to evolve. Adotas notes <http://go.adexchanger.com/ynfWDqP00A0LABo04q00020> , “Social media marketing is helping to blur the lines even further.” The question isn’t whether native ads end up traded in an exchange (this already exists), but whether the concept itself becomes standard or another facet of content marketing.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Is Rakuten Raking In PopSugar? 

TechCrunch is hearing whispers <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABL4Wy0APnp020qD40>  that Japanese ecom giant Rakuten might acquire publisher PopSugar for $580 million. Apparently, we’ll know in the next few weeks whether it’s to be or not. It might seem weird on the surface that Rakuten is buying what’s nominally a celeb gossip site, but it has a history of investing heavily in companies that deal with content, either directly (ebook and audiobook firm OverDrive and video portal Viki) or tangentially <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00q0zL04W00AD2q0nA04>  (attribution vendor DC Storm, retargeter MediaForge and affiliate marketer PopShops). And it’s not as if PopSugar is just a celeb news hub, seeing as it has an audience data repository <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0AnA00r4D0AP00040>  and a commerce/content platform <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000042Bn0L0B0sA4PDAq>  called ShopStyle. Plus, as TechCrunch’s sources point out, Rakuten is gunning to get its products into the hot hands of US consumers. Pushing material goods is a lot easier when you can message on a celeb site with 41 million monthly uniques. 

WPP Debuts Data Consultancy Shop 

WPP has launched a new agency-slash-consulting-firm dubbed Gain Theory to help clients sort out their data strategies. Former Maxus Chief Information Officer Jason Harrison will lead the agency, to be housed under GroupM. Gain Theory will purportedly be independent of GroupM’s media-buying operations. “Because we sit alone as an independent entity, we can bring a point of view to a marketer that’s not connected to any of the decisions that get made about actual tactical executions,” Harrison told the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000042Cn0L0B0tA4PDAq> . “We don’t have a dog in that fight.” Though he adds, “We can connect to the vast array of tools and assets that live within WPP in a really independent and objective way.” Agency, reinvent! 

Agency Rebates, Cont. 

On Monday, Pivotal Research Group’s Brian Wieser downgraded stocks from four of the largest global advertising agencies, citing client pushback over the practice of media and technology supplier rebates.  WPP, Omnicom, Publicis and IPG were switched to “sell” or “hold.” Wieser writes, “The volume and specificity of allegations by aggrieved media owners, former agency executives and marketers are difficult to ignore.” There is a growing concern among marketers that the digital ad buying space isn’t simply complex and opaque, but deliberately so. Read the report at Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/FnDBL00Du0W0P24q000AA04> . 

OTT’s Time To Shine 

A recent research report from The Diffusion Group claims that OTT TV advertising will rise to $31.5 billion in 2018, and traditional TV advertising will fall to $47.5 billion. However, according to Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/gE0D40L0q20nBA0AW000v4P> , “That OTT programming is mostly the same long-form content people watch on a traditional TV broadcast – from AMC’s ‘The Walking Dead’ to ESPN’s ‘SportsCenter’ – but served through connected devices,” which means there will be more total advertising dollars going through TV, despite the descending revenue for traditional TV ads. The report’s author, Alan Wolk, believes that “By 2020, give or take, there will be no distinction between OTT and TV buying.” 

Backing Away From Nielsen 

Time Warner and Viacom are talking with TV advertisers about dropping Nielsen’s demographic-centric measurement approach, Variety reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02F000w400nPW04DABAqL0> . These new deals would measure how spots affect consumer behavior and interactions. “Overall TV ratings are in structural decline,” explained Christopher Vollmer, global managing director of Strategy&’s Digital Services. “Marketers are increasing their spend on digital marketing priorities, especially around social, digital video and mobile. The TV networks need to evolve their data, analytics and insight capabilities.” Advertisers, he added, “will shift their money to the partners where they have the greatest confidence in the return on their video investment. They want and need more than Nielsen age and demo.”

Video Production Moving In-house 

The agency world has long shopped out most of its demand for high-quality video production, but we may now be seeing “an arms race fueled by the rise of digital video,” according to Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0n0HWD0L4Py0A2q040BA00> . Interpublic, MDC and Omnicom have all recently announced major reinvestments in their internal production capabilities. Shops that can't churn out clips for Instagram, live streams for Meerkat and commercials for TV will fall behind. “It’s requisite to the sustainability of the agency,” affirms BBDO’s director of integrated production, David Rolfe. Viewers are migrating to new video content platforms, and marketers are scrambling to follow.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

In Defense Of ‘Do Not Track’ 

In response to Microsoft flipping the killswitch on  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0m8A0000q0Dn20LAWZ> DNT-by-Default, Digital Content Next CEO Jason Kint pens a guest column for Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWo40090ABD00Z0mL02P0Aq>  debunking the death of DNT. Kint challenges five common arguments for why DNT won’t work. Misconceptions about DNT, including a general lack of understanding and that DNT will ruin the free and open Internet that advertising supports, are just excuses that allow the industry to dismiss it, according to Kint. “It’s time for the industry to consider its future rather than protecting the eroding business interests of its incumbent and faceless technology complex,” he writes. “Consumer tools such as Do Not Track can only help build the foundation of trust on which our future success will be built.” 

Twitter Siphons Access To Data 

Twitter has ended its partnership with social data analytics firm DataSift, meaning any third parties that want to access its firehose will have to go through Twitter directly. DataSift claims the decision will seriously damage the ecosystem, and that 80% of its customers use technology that Twitter doesn’t have. “Social networks make money from engagement and advertising,” wrote DataSift CEO Nick Halstead in a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0mAAa0DpZ00> . “Revenue from data should be seen as a secondary concern to distribution, and it should occur only in a privacy-safe way. Better understanding of their audiences means more engagement and more ad spend from brands. More noise = less ad spend.” 

Stalking The Blue Bird 

The Guardian’s Charles Arthur considers the persistent rumors about a Google takeover of Twitter. For one, Google has dropped the ball on the social platform front, a shortcoming that Chairman Eric Schmidt has been quick to admit. Ben Thompson, an independent technology analyst, says Twitter could fix Google’s social woes. According to Thompson, Google “is behind both on mobile … and potentially in brand advertising, which works best in a ‘stream.’ Twitter is a route back to both.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0m0qWD0L4Pb0A2q0Z0BA00> . 

The Online Video Feast 

Facebook is planning to host a group of top agencies and advertisers at its offices a week before the IAB’s 2015 Digital Content NewFronts. According to the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLZWr0APmc020qD40> , “It would seem that Facebook’s timing – just before YouTube, AOL, Yahoo and other big players in web video host the NewFronts – is no accident.” Facebook has never participated in the Digital Content NewFronts because it’s never been a player in original video. But with 3 billion video views a day, and that number growing, Facebook is vying for a seat at the table. 

A Step Beyond Search 

Internet users in the US are conducting an increasing number of searches that start on one device and end on another. “If you are a marketer, you’re building a marketing plan against an audience.” John Cosley, Microsoft’s director of product marketing for the search advertising business group, tells eMarketer. “You have a specific person you’re trying to reach, not a keyword.”  Instead, many marketers are using secondary data from CRM programs in addition to search cues like daypart, location and device to enrich cross-device targeting.

Nielsen Metrics For Triton 

On Friday, Triton Digital earned certification to include Nielsen audience measurement tech in its streaming audio players. That means Nielsen can now measure audiences streaming on Trition players across desktop, Android and iOS devices. Publishers using Triton’s streaming solution can also now offer their broadcast radio clients on-air and streaming metrics, linking audience measurement to simulcasting.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook Admits To EU Tracking ‘Bug’ 

Last week, Belgian academics updated a report <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tq0WN0P0m000DBR20L4qAA0>  that accused Facebook of illegally tracking Internet users in the EU. Facebook has denounced the allegations, but on Thursday, it conceded that a “bug” had been responsible for the debacle. Still, Facebook disputes the accusations. “The report gets it wrong multiple times in asserting how Facebook uses information to provide our service,” Facebook’s European policy chief, Richard Allan, wrote in a blog  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4N0r0P00qD002LBW0SAm> post. Though the debate seemingly dissolved into an argument about semantics, Facebook and other global ad platforms are finding European consumer tracking methods increasingly hard to ignore – especially when some in the US would call those methods standard practice. WSJ has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0N0P4qA02000WLT0s0AmDB> .

Brand–Agency ‘Stalemate’ 

Speaking to The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqtB0m2LW004D0P0AAU0N00> , Deutsche Telekom’s global media chief says that brands and agencies are caught in a stalemate about how to handle programmatic hurdles. Gerhard Louw, who was on the World Federation of Advertisers’ Programmatic task force, says that transparency, media placement and data ownership continue to fuel industry-wide distrust. As a result, vendors are sidestepping agencies and approaching advertisers directly with programmatic offerings. What’s more, “The arbitrage issue worries clients,” said Louw. “We have always seen our agencies as agents that work and act on our behalf and have our best interests at heart, but the arbitrage model – being the buyer and seller of media – really muddles that up completely.” But is “arbitrage” by any other name still a dirty word? 

Ad Blocking Fears 

More users are blocking ads, and across more channels. Digiday reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02V000uN00mPW04DABAqL0>  that CBS Sports shows a 5% ad block rate, compared to upward of 30% on CBS gaming sites. Though the problem is still largely siloed, CBS Interactive CRO David Morris said, “These readers are our future, so once they get used to using ad blockers, it’s going to become a larger issue, not a smaller one.” Did someone say sponsored content? In a separate story, WSJ cites Adobe/PageFair research claiming a 5% rate of ad blocking globally. Read that. <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00NA0L0DW00mB2qW0AvP04>  

Facebook Exchange Patent 

Facebook filed a patent for an exchange that serves both ads and content (though much of that content is advertising in a different form: “paid-for news articles or videos from brands”). In this exchange, advertisers can bid against content such as videos, Facebook wall posts, news articles, photos or gaming apps. The patent would also let Facebook serve the ads or pieces of content on participating publishers’ sites, a move that could undercut content recommendation platforms. Though there are some strong content rec players in the space, Business Insider’s Lara O’Reill <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPmX0Nq0AD00B4w020W0> y points out, “None have the kind of verified data Facebook has in its war chest.” On the other hand, it could be years before the exchange detailed is put into practice, if a patent is granted at all. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPmX0Nq0AD00B4w020W0> . 

Audio In The Mix 

In a Thursday blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0m00NqxY> , the IAB’s VP of industry initiatives, Carl Kalapesi, makes a five-point argument as to why marketers should welcome digital audio into their advertising mixes. Digital audio ads are typically delivered in a noncluttered environment and are often narrative, or “above the fold,” Kalapesi argues, and are increasingly mobile-first. The medium is growing, he adds, citing Edison Research and Triton Digital’s Infinite Dial 2015 study, which suggests 143 million Americans listened to online radio and streamed audio content in the past month. The IAB released its Digital Audio Buyer’s Guide <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bm00yW2A000040NB0DZLPqA>  in conjunction with the blog post.

Gravy Grabs $7.6M 

On Thursday, location-based data analytics firm Gravy closed a $7.6 million round, and new investors included Gannett and MetTel. Gravy’s angle on mobile marketing is “verified” location data, which it offers by linking consumer interests and affinities to actual behaviors and activities. “The funds will be used to increase the scalability of Gravy's GOLD local analytics and context platform, which is the underpinning data-driven technology for all that we do to help major online publishers, hospitality and retail enterprises know their customers better and deliver personalized, relevant messaging and offers,” Gravy’s head of marketing, David Dague, told AdExchanger. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DmBqA0020P0W1AOB00> . 

Ad Tech Revenue Boom 

Ad tech revenue will grow an eye-popping 300% by 2020, from $30 billion in 2015 to $100 billion, says Technology Business Research (TBR). The growth reflects advertisers’ continued migration to digital formats and the growing emergence of self-serve platforms. For its report, TBR split the industry into four segments – DSPs, DMPs, ad exchanges and hybrid platforms – and studied vendors such as Adobe, AppNexus, Criteo, Turn, Google and Rubicon Project. Unsurprisingly, one of the biggest hurdles was putting each ad tech firm into a bucket. Seth Ulinski, senior analyst at TBR, tells MediaPost that they had to do “a lot of modeling to figure out who was doing what.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPm20Oq0AD00B4C020W0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

YouTube’s Rules Of Engagement 

YouTube is debuting a new format for its TrueView ads. Viewers will still be able to opt out of an ad after a few seconds, but brands will have an additional element aimed at generating engagement: interactive cards that “can contain information about the brand or its products, a list of related videos or playlists from the advertiser and … links to the advertiser's website.” Whether or not it solves a problem for advertisers (engagement is a priority, after all), it definitely solves one for YouTube. The company currently gets no revenue when users skip an ad, which occurs 55% to 85% of the time, but will charge for any ads where the user engages with the new cards, regardless of whether they skip the video. Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB000WqA000mPJA0v040D2L> . Related: YouTube has confirmed plans for an ad-free subscription service. TechCrunch has that one <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0JWD0Lw000B4000m1> . 

Broadcasters Still Wary Of Automation 

Two things are stalling programmatic TV, according to former eMediaTRADE CRO Pete Moran: technological hurdles like gateways and connectivity, and the psychology of programmatic. “What we need to hear more of from the folks in the programmatic space is how you are going to drive incremental revenue for me and not disrupt my core business,” Moran  <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLJW20APmx020qD40> tells MediaPost. He adds, however, that programmatic is here to stay and predicts that addressability will take center stage by the end of 2015 or in early 2016. 

Ramaswamy’s Mobile POV 

Writing for WSJ’s CMO blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWJ4mA00yL0PB032> , Google’s top ad platform exec Sridhar Ramaswamy says that capitalizing on micro-moments is key to successful mobile targeting. Micro-moments, he writes, are the fleeting, “intent-rich moments where decisions are being made and preferences being shaped.” Whereas “periodic media sessions,” like hit TV shows, used to rule, marketers must now find their consumers while they’re standing in line or checking their phone while they cook. “In these micro-moments, <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DmBqA0020P0W4AJz00>  consumer expectations are higher than ever,” he writes, adding that as marketers continue to refine their funnel, they won’t have a second shot if they miss that first moment. 

Leaving Rocket Fuel 

Rocket Fuel VP of global partnerships Dave Skinner has left the building, the latest in a string of exits that includes CEO George John and former X+1 CEO John Nardone. Skinner, who ran business development at X+1 for three years before Rocket Fuel bought that company, is moving to LA. More on changes at Rocket Fuel. <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq05mA00AJD0AP00040>  

Commerce Boom 

China’s ecommerce market, which has been on a tear for years and neck and neck with the US market, climbed above $2 trillion in 2014, according to data released Wednesday by the China E-Commerce Research Center. That includes a 50%-plus expansion in online retail YoY. The strongest signs may come from mobile, International Business Times reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/g60D40L0q20mBA0AW000BJP> , where the spread of smartphones and reliable payment services saw web transactions swell by 240% and mobile Internet users grow more than 11%. But for consumers and advertisers, concerns linger. Consumer complaints rose 21%, according to the data, and extreme competition drives up the cost of advertisers and edges out smaller online traders.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

CEO Talkin’ 

Former [x+1] CEO John Nardone has left Rocket Fuel, which acquired the self-serve DSP/DMP hybrid last August <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqiB0m2LW004D0P0AAT0D00> , and joined UK-based ad-serving tech firm Flashtalking as its new chief executive. He replaces the firm’s elusive CEO and founder, Paul Cunningham <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pmj00q2U0D> . Nardone wastes no time on his new company’s strategy and tells MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000Pmk00q2V0D>  that Flashtalking doesn’t have ambitions to be anything more than an ad-serving platform. “But there is an ambition for it to be the ad-serving platform that is uniquely configured and positioned to support the complex programmatic needs of a rapidly evolving marketplace.” Ad serving is back. Not that it ever left. 

Facebook Wins Video Advertisers 

Facebook could overtake YouTube as the leading video advertising platform in 2015, according to a survey from video ad tech firm Mixpo <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0mqW0D00lAWB0D4PA> . Of the 125 agencies, brands and publishers surveyed, 87% claim they plan to run Facebook video ad campaigns and only 81.5% will run YouTube campaigns this year. “The advertisers we talk to are all generally interested in running video ads in social,” wrote Mixpo VP of Marketing Justin Kistner. “What we see holding them back is a lack of experience. We created this report to not only give advertisers more insights on the macro trends, but also specific, tactical knowledge from actual campaigns." 

Target Practice 

Target is taking a, well, targeted approach to app building. The retailer’s most recent offering is an app to promote its upcoming Lilly Pulitzer clothing line. It seems like Target has an app for everything in its store, each highly tailored to a specific audience, and Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/f00DA0L0DX00mB2qW0AmP04>  lists its portfolio. A Target spokeswoman points to the value of digital engagement, saying, “Guests who engage with Target across multiple channels – in stores and digital channels – become more engaged guests ... and spend three times more.” The “do-it-all mobile strategy” isn’t unique to Target, but is there ROI for the retailer that features a suite of short-term or narrowly focused apps? 

Can Google Make Itself An Offer It Can’t Refuse? 

A Marketing Land <http://go.adexchanger.com/AD0n04WB200AmPq00L0Y0DA>  article claims Google is leaving unmonetized search and data capabilities on the table since it doesn’t let advertisers load in their different assets. Facebook, by contrast, has CRM matching program Custom Audiences, data from Facebook users and third-party partnerships with companies like Datalogix. If Google were to expand advertisers’ data capabilities on AdWords, it could be “one of the most lucrative advertising programs Google has ever launched.” Of course, Google is allegedly still <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0m00DqoZ>  struggling to reconcile consumer privacy with better advertising capabilities. In other Google search news, sources tell BuzzFeed <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bm00qW2A000040EB0D0LPqA>  that Google is working on a new product that connects search users with local home-service providers, though it wasn’t clear exactly how that connection would occur.

Expanding Reach By Embracing Rivals 

Can a publisher/media company hybrid work fairly with its competitors? Yahoo insists it can, which is why it’s pitching itself as an ad platform that does not overvalue itself or undervalue rivals. Still, it’s fighting a two-front war. As reported by The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/o021000rE00mPW04DABAqL0> , Yahoo hopes to expand its reach and show it’s agnostic – thereby attracting more advertisers – by selling ads on apps it doesn’t own. Meanwhile, as a publisher, the company has invested in its news offering in an effort to build out its mobile and display business. Yahoo has focused its resources on mobile (where it recently grew 23% quarter on quarter, despite a 10% revenue decline since 2012), but as with many publishers, high mobile usage hasn’t been matched by high mobile ad revenue.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google's Search Data 

Once upon a time, Google's ad platform chief, Sridhar Ramaswamy, locked horns with his peer, Susan Wojcicki (now YouTube CEO), over the proper use of the company's valuable search data. The Information's Amir Efra tells the tale of some meetings where Ramaswamy challenged Wojcicki about the defensible uses of that data. Namely, should Google target ads with it? Their compromise: "Mr. Ramaswamy agreed to use search-history data to target ads on YouTube and other Google sites when a person is 'logged in' to their Google account." When exactly that will happen is unclear. Also: Is this the start of Google's login-based ID solution? More <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DmBqA0020P0WeAss00>  (sub required). Pair with AdExchanger's own ponderous story on Ramaswamy <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0mtA0000q0Df20LAWs> . 

Immovable Fraud 

The digital ad fraud issue is far from solved, The Wall Street Journal’s Jack Marshall  <http://go.adexchanger.com/GmB0As20Du4gW0AL0000P0q> reports. Data from comScore suggests 46% of all digital ad impressions served during Q3 2014 went unseen. ComScore measured the exact same percentage of non-viewable ads during Q3 2013. Index Exchange chief Andrew Casale agrees that fraud hasn’t lessened. “Has it slowed at all? Not really, and until we see those numbers drop, what it tells us is the ‘bad guys’ are still seeing enough financial incentive to play the game,” he said. “The industry is trying to squash conversation about the topic because it’s not good for business. Frankly, it’s not good for my business either.” 

Programmatic Stats 

Building on its July programmatic report, data from BI Intelligence <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Ph40s0DvAmq2>  estimates that programmatic transactions will makeup the majority of non-search digital ad spend (52%) this year, with 30.6% of that digital ad spend in RTB platforms and 21.7% in non-RTB programmatic channels. BI says this year US programmatic ad revenue will exceed $15 billion and media-agency trading desks will continue to be decentralized, which could fuel programmatic spending from agency clients. Meanwhile, pricing for premium and guaranteed placements are rising while miscellaneous inventory prices continue to decrease. 

Beijing-Boston Alliance 

Cheetah Mobile sunk $24 million into Nanigans as part of a strategic partnership between the companies. “Nanigans will be the exclusive third-party advertising automation software provider used by Cheetah Mobile for advertising spend in certain social and mobile apps, until the end of the term of the commercial agreement,” reads the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPmi0sq0AD00B4w020W0> . Beijing-based Cheetah Mobile hosts more than 395 million monthly active users. The partnership follows Cheetah Mobile’s recent decision to acquire mobile ad network MobPartner. 

B2B Ecommerce Cooking 

According to Forrester, B2B ecommerce sales will account for $780 billion this year, or about 9.3% of total ecommerce sales. By 2020, B2B ecommerce is expected to eclipse the trillion-dollar mark, and will represent 12% of the industry. So while “online expense management” and “industrial supply efficiency” aren’t exactly media buzzwords, prepare for a world of ecommerce where they’re increasingly important.

Putting Machines In Charge 

The ad industry has undergone a massive transformation at the hands of big data, and the same thing is about to happen to health care, crime prevention and banking – to name a few sectors. But as the technology soaks into other industries, concerns are surfacing. “What happens if my algorithm is wrong? Someone sees the wrong ad,” Claudia Perlich, a data scientist who works for an ad-targeting startup, tells The New York Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0mzA0q0l0BAL0PDs2>  “What’s the harm? It’s not a false positive for breast cancer.” The dilemma is that the algorithms are built to avoid human oversight, but human bias can be a vital application.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Captive Mobile Video Audiences 

Writing for Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0m07WD0L4Pg0A2q0n0BA00> , Google’s head of display (and now YouTube ad products, too), Neal Mohan, says TV consumption habits have evolved and brands must adapt. “Our shift to constant connectivity has opened up amazing opportunities for marketers to reach consumers in the very moments they are leaning in,” Mohan writes. “At the same time, it has elevated consumer expectation, making our task at once easier and more difficult.” Mohan says brands need to match media to the mindset and medium of the consumer, view the skip button as an indicator of relevance and be diligent about mobile metrics. 

King Facebook 

Facebook is maintaining its stronghold as the dominant social platform, according to data from Strategy Analytics. Marketing Land reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/ymnWDqP00A0LAB804h00020>  that the social giant raked in 75% of all ad spend on social networks in 2014, grabbing $11.4 billion of a total $15.3 billion. But Facebook hasn’t cornered the market entirely. “While Facebook currently dominates the global social network market, its absence in China allows local social networks such as QZone and Tencent Weibo to gain traction in the rapidly expanding Chinese digital advertising market,” writes analyst Leika Kawasaki in a release <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0miA0000q0D920LAWn> . Social media advertising grew 41% in 2014, and the report estimates total spend will swell to $19.8 billion in 2015 and $24.2 billion in 2016. 

Nailing Search 

Speaking of social, Pinterest made its seventh acquisition on Friday, snapping up mobile publishing startup Hike Labs for an undisclosed sum. Hike Labs is tiny, but Pinterest is betting the buy will help it tackle its search and discovery issues. According to Business Insider <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0nA0DB0Wa2Lq00mA00j4P0> , “If Pinterest can nail visual search, it can nail search advertising, and if it can nail search advertising, it will be taking on a market traditionally dominated by Google's AdWords.” In March, the social scrapbooking site raised a $367 million funding round, bringing its market cap to $11 billion. 

Broadcast Doldrums 

The party might be ending for broadcast media, even for TV’s prime-time spots. Despite the fact that “the average network TV rating has declined over the past 20-plus years, the average CPM has risen as the broadcast networks adjusted their prices – and advertisers’ costs – upwards.” In 2014, broadcast CPMs fell by 2.4%, ominous considering it occurred at a time when the market as a whole was improving. According to Neil Klar, CEO of SQAD, “The numbers we’re looking at don't represent a significant decline, but it’s rare to see it go down at all.” Broadcasters’ bottom lines might finally start taking a hit from programmatic, over-the-top TV services and declining audiences. Read the article at MediaPost. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bm00kW2A000040nB0DbLPqA>  

Television’s Address 

PlaceIQ wants to bake its location analytics into the nascent addressable TV market. Ad Age’s Kate Kaye reports  <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DcA02000BWn0q4mlLP0A> that PlaceIQ’s deals with Starcom MediaVest and Acxiom “takes PlaceIQ's location data showing specific businesses people have actually visited and matches it to particular households through ... set-top box targeting.” The service lets businesses “aim ads to people who have frequented rivals' location,” but no brands will admit to using it.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Platforms Under Siege 

Privacy officials from France, Spain and Italy are looking into Facebook’s data collection practices, The Wall Street Journal reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PmQ00q2Q0e> . “The pile-on is a sign of an increasingly acrimonious environment for US technology companies in Europe,” writes the Journal’s Sam Schechner. “Antitrust officials at the EU plan to move in coming weeks against Google in a long-running competition probe. Amazon and Apple have been named in EU investigations into corporate-tax affairs. France and Germany are pushing for new rules to regulate big Internet companies.” A recent Belgian Privacy Commission study appeared to prepare the ground for legal challenges to Facebook’s use of cookies. Read AdExchanger’s coverage of that <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPmR0eq0AD00B4R020W0> . 

$100B For Mobile 

The global mobile ad market is poised to hit $101 billion in 2016, eMarketer  <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqSB0m2LW004D0P0AAS0e00> predicts. That’s a 430% increase from 2013, and will account for more than 50% of all digital ad spend. China and the US are leading the global market in both device use and mobile ad spend. “Growth in mobile ad spending is being driven by consumer adoption of mobile devices,” writes eMarketer, adding that in 2016 there will be more than 2 billion smartphone users worldwide, a fourth of whom will be based in China. In China and elsewhere, “Many consumers are accessing the internet mobile-first and mobile-only, so leading advertisers allocate their digital expenditure to mobile accordingly.” 

Weather’s Trifecta 

The Weather Company’s decision to focus on video across mobile and desktop is paying dividends. “On desktop alone, the company drew more than 13.2 million unique video viewers” in February, Digiday reports, putting the company in the enviable position of offering audience tracking and branded video experiences across the triple crown of websites, mobile apps and TV. The problem for The Weather Company mirrors that of many in the industry: a mobile ad system that requires “optimization” and consumer pushback on video ad formats.

Wanted: Publisher Revenue Diversity 

In a Q <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0UemWPU0A00> &A with NiemanLab’s Joseph Lichterman, The Economist deputy editor Tom Standage says digital publishing’s reliance on advertising is problematic. “An awful lot of [news organizations] seem to have business models that are dependent on advertising, and I don’t think it’s going to work.” Instead, the Economist wants to reinvent. “We’re switching toward what we call thought leadership, which is we sell sponsorship of conferences, with white papers, with online advertising as well,” Standage said. “It’s not straightforward display advertising. It allows advertisers to associate themselves with particular topic areas, or raise their profiles in particular areas.” It remains to be seen if the many VC-backed outlets can stand on their own feet, but for Standage, “I don’t think the current model is sustainable.” 

Programmatic Turns 10 

Wednesday marked the first online ad exchange’s 10th anniversary. In 2005, Brian O’Kelley was at Right Media, where “almost by accident, I built a feature that allowed companies to bid into each other’s auctions.” A patent that O’Kelley shares with Amy Kang would go on to “spawn hundreds of companies and billions of dollars of IPOs and acquisitions.” At 10 years old, programmatic digital spending just topped $10 billion in 2014, and according to eMarketer is expected to more than double that by 2016. Happy birthday indeed. Brian O’Kelley’s look back is at the AppNexus blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4e0V0P00qD002LBW0VAm> .

Programmatic Zinged In Viewability Study 

Sizmek claims mobile ad viewability tops desktop, and ads served programmatically are less viewable than those served direct. Its study of 240 billion impressions found “desktop standard banner ads had a 48% viewability rate, way behind those of mobile at nearly 80%,” reports Mumbrella <http://go.adexchanger.com/gX0D40L0q20mBA0AW000XeP> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

AOL And Fox Forge Digital Deal 

AOL and Fox Sports entered into a multiyear partnership for video content on Wednesday. Fox Sports will host AOL video on its digital properties, like @TheBuzzer and Garbage Time. Fox Sport Digital’s VP of bizdev, Ben Maggin, tells Adweek <http://go.adexchanger.com/f009A0L0DS00mB2qW0ANP04>  that the monetization options on AOL’s platforms were a big draw, as was AOL’s agreement that Fox will maintain control of its ad deals. Seperately, stock analysis provider Trefis chimes in on AOL’s growing programmatic biz. “While [AOL’s] overall revenue might decline sequentially this quarter, the year-ahead trends remain positive as AOL’s revenue from new verticals such as the programmatic platform and video ads gain increasing momentum,” reads the report <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000092Tm0L0B0OA4PDAq> . 

Challenging The MCN 

One of YouTube’s biggest stars is hoping to upend the MCN model. Michelle Phan is teaming up with Endemol Beyond to launch Icon Network, a digital channel that will host and produce original content and content creators, and stream that content on social networks and OTT TV. “Icon is entering the market at a time when creators are getting increasingly critical of MCNs,” Andreas Goeldi, CTO at web video firm Pixability, told the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00P0UL09W00AD2q0mA04> . “Combine that with new platforms like Vessel attacking MCNs’ turf, plus networks like Icon going after specific verticals, and we’re suddenly looking at a very interesting space.” 

DAR Goes Nielsen OCR 

Does online not imply mobile? Nielsen thinks so, since it rebranded Online Campaign Ratings to Digital Ad Ratings, a pivot designed to highlight that it includes mobile measurements. “The enhancements we’re making to Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings are about simplicity, and reflect Nielsen’s ability to grow and adapt our services to meet the needs of clients,” Megan Clarken, Nielsen’s EVP of global product leadership, said in a release <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPmV09q0AD00B4Q020W0> . “As part of our ongoing effort to measure Total Audience, we will continue to evolve our offerings to provide the most accurate picture of the consumer, wherever, whenever and however they view content.” Interface enhancements include a revamped dashboard, exportable charts and simplified campaign ID search tools. 

Mobile Growth Spurt 

Search, display and mobile US ad spend surged in 2015’s first quarter, according to IgnitionOne <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000092Wm0L0B0RA4PDAq> . Mobile display led the pack, growing 143% compared to the same period last year. MediaPost has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0m009qSX> . Programmatic display climbed 34% and paid search spiked 26% YoY. Meanwhile, eMarketer estimates <http://go.adexchanger.com/uY0000DB4L0A0T029PqWAm0>  programmatic ad spend will swell nearly 50% to hit $14.88 billion in 2015, accounting for 55% of total digital ad spend. Mobile will get the lion’s share of programmatic spend in the US this year. Next year, mobile programmatic spending will see a more pronounced acceleration and account for nearly 70% of programmatic digital display ad spend. 

Programmatic IoT 

En route to its upcoming IPO, API management and predictive analytics platform Apigee debuted a tool designed to bring programmatic tech to the Internet of Things. Silicon Angle reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/ym9WDqP00A0LABZ04U00020> , “Apigee is targeting the complexity and confusion that will arise as a torrent of real-time transmissions begin flowing among new Internet of Things (IoT) devices.” Speaking of the IoT, the NYT  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4a0W0P00qD002LBW00Am> writes about Amazon’s new Dash Button, a physical “buy” button slapped onto household appliances. Amazon says the Dash Button is about testing consumers’ comfort with brands and interconnected technology entering their homes.

Writing for MediaBizBloggers, former PHD chief Steve Grubbs says adland is lost in a discussion on rebates, media kickbacks and arbitraging inventory. "My evolved point of view is that a) agencies must not violate any laws, b) they must be honest in their contracts and transparent in their fees and c) they must be very clear about conflicts of interest. All else should be fair game,” argues Grubbs, whose consulting business is called Second Act Media. “If agencies make money using their clients’ money… so what? If they act as media principals to arbitrage inventory or extract incremental value from media suppliers for agency use… ok, fine. What matters is that agencies are providing quality media services to their clients for a fair price.” Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40X0A240BNLD0WmP00q0A0> . 

Media: Now Tinier 

Publishers are preparing for a world where a reader’s first impression is via wearable devices. The New York Times is developing <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000O2040qAmLPDB4Y0WA0>  ways to produce “one-sentence stories, crafted specially for small screens,” that will let a user continue reading a full article on a phone or tablet through Apple’s Handoff tech. Elsewhere, Digiday reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q04A0DB0WZ2Lq00mA00P4P0>  that CNN will build its wearables services around personalization, aiming to be “the world’s alert platform.” The Economist is taking it one step further with plans to home in on audio engagement, eschewing the notifications and text other publishers are developing specifically for Apple Watch. Publishers, get small! 

App-splosion 

Google and Apple are poised to see their app store revenues double by 2018, with in-app ad revenues more than tripling during that time frame, according to forecast data from App Annie and IDC released on Tuesday. And App Annie CEO Bertrand Schmitt tells Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/f005A0L0D000mB2qW0ARP04> , “I would consider this projection conservative.” For the forecast, researchers only studied sales from Apple and Google, which excludes Amazon and Microsoft sales figures and also omits third-party stores. “The mix between paying for apps versus advertising continues to vary greatly by country, as well,” points out Re/code’s Ina Fried. “In-app advertising accounts for more than two-thirds of revenue in India and the United Kingdom, for example, but less than a quarter in Russia and Japan.” 

Supercookie Opt-Out Starts Now 

Verizon users will now be able to opt out of the wireless provider's “supercookies,” the NYT reported Tuesday <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PSB1D000qA2504L0m> . Verizon first agreed to ditch the heavy-duty tracking codes in January, after four Democratic congressional members from the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation wrote to Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam demanding an explanation for the firm’s tracking and privacy policies. “As the mobile advertising ecosystem evolves, and our advertising business grows, delivering solutions with best-in-class privacy protections remains our focus,” Verizon spokeswoman Debra Lewis said in a statement. “As a reminder, we never share information with third parties that identifies our customers as part of our advertising programs.” Read AdExchanger’s “zombie cookie” coverage  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bm00TW2A0000405B0D2LPqA> from January. 

Ad Tech Firms Cooling On The Market 

Ad tech share prices have taken a beating since the start of the year, according to data from LUMA Partners. The strategic advisory firm says that the overall value of ad tech stocks fell 12% during 2015’s first quarter. Rocket Fuel, which is scrambling to appoint a new chief executive (AdExchanger story <http://go.adexchanger.com/f005A0L0D300mB2qW0AUP04> ), has suffered a 43% dip in its share price. Meanwhile, during that period, TubeMogul’s stock sank 39%, Tremor’s dipped 17%, Millennial Media’s dropped 12% and Criteo’s fell 2%. LUMA Partners CEO Terence Kawaja says investors are “confused” by the ad tech market and “probably won’t focus [on the companies] until some larger cap names come to market.” Read more via the WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PVD5A40LmB004A> .

SMG’s Addressable TV Tool 

Starcom MediaVest Group released an addressable TV measurement tool on Tuesday, in partnership with PlaceIQ and Acxiom. The product, dubbed SMG Maps TV, builds on Starcom’s SMP Maps location analytics platform, which was released last year. “We have been both activating and providing insights to major brands using mobile media for years by connecting physical and digital consumer behavior through the lens of location," said PlaceIQ CEO Duncan McCall. The tool will launch on several addressable TV channels, though as MediaPost points out <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0mXA0q060BAL0PD52> , it’s unclear which ones.
