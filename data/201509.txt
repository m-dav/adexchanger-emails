News Round Up

Learning The Native Tongue

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer gave her thoughts on ad blocking during a Q&A at IAB MIXX during Advertising Week. Mayer believes ad blockers are wrong when they say their products will elevate UX and vibrancy on mobile or desktop, according to The Drum’s Stephen Lepitak. And Mayer pointed to native advertising – “We’re big believers in native” – as the publishing industry’s counterweight to ad blocking. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PPB00000Ay4Dq02yWj0> .

Old Dog, New Trick

Comcast debuted Watchable, a digital video hub the company has evidently been working on for some months. Though still in beta, Watchable will support viewing on multiple platforms, including web, app and over-the-top, as reported by Frank Pallota at CNN. The list of early partners is a veritable who’s-who in digital media, with companies like BuzzFeed, GoPro, Vice, Vox and The Onion. The service is entirely ad-supported, with creators getting a 70% cut. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0kyA00QyD0AP00040> .

Sun Rising In The West

In the Cold War between Madison Ave. and Silicon Valley, the tech titans are winning. Sydney Ember of The New York Times identifies Facebook’s new video measurement based off TV metrics and Google’s decision to allow first-party CRM data as examples of how tech companies are throwing more weight around. Mad Ave. is “still the heart of the business,” but that feels pretty sentimental, and NY ad tech companies lack the clout to compete with the platforms out west. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBR000Ayy0A200WL4qPl00> .

Programmatic Overhaul

Everybody knows we’re entering Programmatic 3.0, duh, but what does that actually mean? Ad Age’s Alexandra Bruell talks to Shenan Reed, president of digital for WPP’s MEC, who says market pressures and tech companies will pivot to quality inventory – as opposed to the price- and quality-reducing effects of excess inventory. Just like with print, maybe it works better if ads are sparse and strategic, as opposed to on every single page. Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0Pm40y0DSAyq2> .

News Round Up

Busy As A Bot

Digital Content Next released a report Monday in conjunction with White Ops on bot fraud activity. No pub is cited by name, but sites that do audience extension (by retargeting their audiences) are more likely to have bot-ridden inventory. White Ops founder and CEO Michael Tiffany said in an email to AdExchanger that “the category of ‘premium’ should be *defined* by low bot numbers like this. … [A]nd these publishers are making quality on that front into a competitive issue.” The full report <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP00g0QL0sW00AD2q0yA04> .

Laissez-Faire

Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook and Apple are turning their attention to India after years of focus on China. As Vindu Goel at The New York Times points out, tech companies have had it to here with Chinese restrictions on their products. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was greeted enthusiastically <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PhBRD000qA2s04L0y>  by the tech lobby on visiting California, could see a mobile revolution to rival his bigger neighbor to the north.

Live TV Ain’t Dead Yet

Despite lukewarm results from recent live TV musicals (like NBC’s Peter Pan Live last year), advertisers are paying top dollar for spots on upcoming live renditions of “Grease” and “The Wizard of Oz,” according to Jeanine Poggi at Ad Age. What gives? It’s important to bear in mind that in an age of fractured viewing, TV that can guarantee live audiences (see: the Super Bowl) has tremendous marketing advantages, since it allows for sequential or simultaneous campaigns on digital.

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWo4yA00ZL0PB0D2> 71% Of Ad-Block Users Would Consider Whitelisting Sites That Don’t Suck
Twenty-two percent of Murphy’s respondents said they’d be willing to pay to support sites in exchange for additional content or an ads-free experience. Whether they actually do it is another question – but the inclination seems to be there.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02H0003o00yPW04DABAqL0> Data-Driven Thinking column...When Marketers Lose Control Of Their Campaigns by Eoin Townsend, Collective
It’s time for marketers to take center stage. When they do, the industry will thrive, grow and evolve in a way that’s good for everyone in the ecosystem.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0y00oq4I> Publishers Weigh Options To Combat Ad Blocking
"Publishers need to get together and have a unified solution," Stephanie Layser, VP of ad ops and programmatic for A Plus said. "Publishers are scared of telling people they can’t view their content unless you view an ad first, because they know that person will go somewhere else and get that content for free."

News Round Up

Matching The Search User

Google will widen support for first-party data onboarding, Digiday’s Garett Sloane reports. “The new program lets advertisers import their customer lists to Google and market to those audiences in Gmail, search and YouTube.” It’s a move straight out of the playbooks of many other Internet companies, including Facebook. How well can CRM demand compete with keyword intent in the Google auction?  <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW08L0000oP02BAqDy0M40A> More.

Cookie Exploit

If you thought cookies had a bad rap before, Carnegie Mellon’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) issued a warning stating that “cookies set via HTTP requests may allow a remote attacker to bypass HTTPS and reveal private session information.” Read it here <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0oA0DB0WN2Lq00yA0094P0> . Because it’s impossible to tell how a cookie was set, it can be used to infiltrate sibling domains. Here’s CERT’s hypothetical: Consider two domains: foo.example.com and bar.example.com. (FUBAR! Get it?) The server for foo.example.com might set a cookie for “example.com.” Consequently, that cookie can be used to access the private sessions within bar.example.com, even if it uses HTTPS. That’s an issue that even affects ostensibly secure sites like Google <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ta0Wo0P0y000DBO20L4qAA0>  and Bank of America. The Stack has some additional analysis <http://go.adexchanger.com/gP0D40L0q20yBA0AW000boP> .

Your Daily Ad Block

Addressing a lamentable lack of stories on ad blocking, The Guardian’s John Naughton contemplates the topic and wonders what comes next. “The good news is that the ensuing crisis will compel us finally to look for what we should have invented decades ago, namely sustainable business models for the web. For example, it’s possible that cryptocurrencies <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0ycA0q0Q0BAL0PDo2>  might enable the ‘micro-payments <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0Ro0Ly0DB0d0W0q4P20A0A> ’ that would make users to pay a tiny amount for any article they read.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqeB0y2LW004D0P0AAS0o00> .

Please, Please, Do No Evil

Google parent Alphabet just poached the lauded director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Thomas Insel. As noted in Insel’s interview with Antonio Regalado of the MIT Technology Review, there are clear incentives for tech companies to enter the stagnant healthcare industry (which is 20% of US GDP). Life sciences may be separated from Google within Alphabet, but there are echoes of the marketing titan behind Insel’s description of his mandate, “To get the right treatments at the right time for the right people.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LoT2fADP0y00A0> .

News Round Up

Sourced Traffic Is For Suckers

Bloomberg Businessweek’s cover story this month is a dive into the world of fraudulent traffic. A while ago advertisers hoped digital display would be as effective but more efficient vs. TV advertising: similar reach, but way less cost. But last year, Heineken’s senior media director, Ron Amram, was stunned to discover that digital ROI was 2-1, compared to TV’s 6-1. Much of the problem was due to nonhuman traffic. Bloomberg cybersecurity reporter Michael Riley, who co-authored the article, told AdExchanger in an email that the investigation “quickly ran into a wall of front companies, fake publishing empires, and layer upon layer of middlemen designed to disguise the source of fraudulent clicks.” For brands and ad tech players: Be wary, whether they’re based out of Russia, Israel or Brooklyn, these are the most sophisticated Potemkin Villages you can possibly imagine. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/FyDBL00gw0W0P2iq000AA04> .

NDN No More

News Distribution Network, the video monetization platform for all AP member companies (see AdExchanger’s <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000i2hy0L0B0xA4PDAq>  coverage), has dropped its NDN moniker in favor of the name Inform. Along with the rebrand comes a unified publisher offering for content delivery and personalization, born from three acquisitions NDN made over the years. Now at 27 million uniques and 230 million video views a month, CEO Greg Peters says a big development imperative will be more mobile personalization. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0yqW0D00yAiB0i4PA> .

Power To The Pubs

LiveRail announced the launch of the Partner Program, designed to connect proven media buyers with publishers searching for specific advertisers. While the blog post touting Partner Program never uses the word “premium,” the initiative is meant to facilitate deals between partners and select clients. Whether you see it as programmatic absorbing direct deals or as the natural next step for a platform like Facebook, it’s clear publishers are exerting more influence over the kind and quality of advertiser that appears on their sites. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0ji0Ly0DB0z0W0q4P20A0A> .

This Is (Not) The End

The programmatic ecosystem has taken big hits lately (stories about ad blocking or brands pulling back on spending, etc). These articles are partially substantive and partially PR-motivated. But Google’s VP of display and video advertising, Neal Mohan, has some bracing stats about programmatic’s prospects. Mohan writes at the DoubleClick blog that the number of advertisers on the platform have doubled in the past 18 months and that mobile programmatic spending is expected to go from $4.7 billion this year to $22.8 billion in 2019. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0i0P4qA02000WLk0A0AyDB> .

The Value Of Video

App publishers can now promote their goods using mobile video ads on Twitter’s feed. In a blog post, company product manager Ivan Santana said the ability to “(show) people a preview of your app” nearly tripled conversion rates, according to Twitter’s internal data from beta testing. Now app publishers looking to drive installs can show how awesome their product is, rather than using 140 characters to tell it. Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0y00iqBl> on.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/ldBqX000LyDP0A2A4000M0W> The Changing Handshake Of Programmatic Deals
The best way to negotiate private marketplaces, said MediaMath VP Sam Cox, is when the seller states her costs, the buyer states his goals and they find a price in between. If the two sides can’t agree, they should simply walk away.

News Round Up

EU Pluribus Unum

The EU’s top court issued some sharp statements regarding Facebook’s 15-year-old data-sharing agreement with US government agencies. The nonbinding decision from the EU’s advocate general  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00y0Xd0W8DP0L0A00> said European “Facebook users are not informed that their personal data will be generally accessible to the US security agencies." Stephanie Bodoni reports for Bloomberg that other tech powerhouses expressed concern though their trade group DigitalEurope (which also represents Apple, Google and Microsoft) that an EU decision to halt Facebook’s data flow would have major commercial repercussions for US companies with similar data-sharing agreements. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/qyAW0A0DL9004d02B0PY00q> .

Ad Block Opportunity

AppNexus CEO Brian O’Kelley takes up the ad-blocking topic in a think piece for Forbes and brings it down to supply and demand economics. “If ad blocking reduces the volume of available digital impressions … advertisers will have to pay more for available inventory, potentially resulting in more revenue for some publishers.” In other words, smart pubs could benefit.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000d2Zy0L0B0aA4PDAq> Read the whole thing.

Take Your Time

The Financial Times says its time-based ads, which charge brands based on exposure time, have contributed $2.2 million over the past nine months, money that the business would otherwise have lost out on. But don’t expect all publishers to adopt the idea, writes Digiday reporter Lucia Moses. The FT is a niche publication, so it doesn’t offer scale anyway, and 85% of its ads are brand marketing, more than double the online average. Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tc0We0P0y000DB020L4qAA0> on.

Cost Per Message

Facebook VP Andrew Bosworth revealed some of the details of the company’s plan to monetize Messenger, one of its two messaging services. The plan is to introduce an ad type the company dubs “click to message.” The product would allow businesses to place a “Message” button on Facebook ads. If a user follows up with a message or comment to the company, then it’s charged. Business Insider’s Jillian D’Onfro also cites other examples of Facebook including these “calls to action” in their marketing. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0y01WD0L4Pd0A2q0e0BA00> .

Safety First

The Internet of Things Security Foundation (ITSF) has been launched with industry backers that include Vodafone, BT and Intel. The organization includes more than 30 companies and is dedicated to addressing security issues in IoT products. Tony Connelly reports for The Drum that anything from baby monitors to automobiles have absorbed major PR and security setbacks recently, and convincing the public that new connected devices are safe is imperative for the emerging industry. Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0eWD0Le000B4000y2> .

Clocking In On Instagram

The day after Instagram crossed the 400 million user mark, a study by Mavrck examined the hour-by-hour breakdown of Instagram usage based on 1.3 million posts, and how the time of day could be a tool for advertisers, according to Christopher Heine at Adweek. For instance, while there’s a very low number of posts added between 6 a.m. and noon, this period could be a marketing sweet spot. (Users are still checking their feeds, but with less competition for the ad.) The study also showed that age is an important marketing indicator, with younger people having more “influence” (i.e., followers) than their elders.

Today's Must Read

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00aP0ALAWPXyB02q000> Turn Appoints Media Vet Bruce Falck To CEO Post
His transition to Turn comes five months after longtime CEO Bill Demas' departure and several executive shifts at the top of the organization. Like a number of ad networks and early demand-side platforms, Turn too was pressured to reach profitability, AdExchanger sources claimed.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/GyB0Aa20D14TW0AL0000P0q> Data-Driven Thinking column...Programmatic 3.0: The Next Paradigm In Inventory Procurement by Chris O'Hara, Krux
As we sled the downward slope of the programmatic buying Hype Cycle, we are starting to see some new trends in inventory procurement – namely, a strategy that involves replacing some or all of the licensed programmatic architecture, as well a growing reliance on one’s own data.

 <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LaU22ADP0y00A0> Nielsen Challenger Symphony Advanced Media Releases Cross-Screen Measurement
“The reason we exist is the media market has changed so dramatically, but the measurement of media really hasn’t,” said SAM’s president and CEO, Charles Buchwalter. “If they can have a lens into how their desired targets are consuming media on a real-time basis, that helps them optimize their media spend.”

Although other media companies use MarketShare, including Turner, it’s primarily been a tool for CMOs. But by adding it to Bloomberg’s data arsenal, the business media giant plans to enable more consultative conversations with clients.

“Our pursuit of cross-device mapping is as an infrastructure provider,” CEO John Nardone said. “We’re not in the business of competing with our DSP partners or our agencies who are doing media buying. We don’t need to play that game.”

News Round Up

Ad Blockalypse

The Randall Rothenberg “calm down about ad blockers” media tour continues, this time with a column at Ad Age (following up on Monday’s WSJ Q <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWa4yA006L0PB0Y2> &A, where he also referred to ad blocking as “the latest crisis du jour”). In a scathing piece, the IAB CEO says profiting off ad blocking is “robbery, plain and simple -- an extortionist scheme.” He cites the potential damage to the overall economy (advertising represents $350 billion in direct sales and $9 trillion in consumer purchases), but that’s a faulty analogy. Ad spending has remained steady at 1-2% of GDP since the early 20th century. The money will flow, just maybe not through IAB ad units. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0P7BZD000qA2a04L0y> .

Digital News Still Paying Off

Axel Springer is reportedly interested in purchasing Business Insider for $560 million, according to Re/code’s Peter Kafka. Axel Springer purchased a minority share of Business Insider early this year at a $200 million valuation, so the rumored price is a big step up. Business Insider and Axel Springer execs haven’t commented, but this could be the next in a series of recent big-money investments and acquisitions of digital-native news sites. Details <http://go.adexchanger.com/FyDBL00090W0P2bq000AA04> .

The Price Of Security

It’s uncommon to hear about competitors like Google, Microsoft, Baidu and Qualcomm teaming up, but the four tech titans did just that on a joint $110 million investment in web security firm CloudFlare. (The round was led by Fidelity.) CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince says the deal is entirely strategic, with specific goals attached to each new investor. Forbes reporter Kate Vinton says CloudFlare will be expanding its international and mobile applications, as the one-two punch of the Chinese market coming online and mobile web browsing concerns drive top-level strategy. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqaB0y2LW004D0P0AA10b00> .

Wax And Wane

Whispers of a potential brand/agency pullback from the ad tech ecosystem turned into a shout on Tuesday. In the wake of Belkin’s decision to pull back from programmatic spending <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPy20bq0AD00B4b020W0> , as reported by Suzanne Vranica at The Wall Street Journal, there are now agencies going on the record with concerns over programmatic’s impact. Carat Global and 22squared are both cited by Laurie Sullivan at MediaPost as being unhappy with the state of ad tech. It’s worth noting, though, that agencies are pushing for improvement, not abandoning digital. Read  <http://go.adexchanger.com/DW3400c0ABD00b0yL02P0Aq> it.

Get It While It’s Hot

Facebook engineer T.R. Vishwanath wrote a post on its developers blog <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB004WqA000yPbA0d040D2L>  Tuesday pitching the ability to publish directly to Instant Articles from a site’s own CMS. And first up to the plate is The Washington Post, which announced that it would be publishing 100% of its content directly to Facebook’s news service. WaPo redesigned its own site earlier this year to make it faster and more reader-friendly, but publisher Fred Ryan still sees Facebook as “a faster, more seamless news reading experience.” The newspaper has already sold ad placements for its articles on Facebook.

Adobe unsurprisingly takes the lead, with SAS and Google trailing right behind. But in a sign of where the market is headed, attribution companies like Visual IQ also make an appearance on the chart, occupying the same niche status in the “challenger” quadrant as predictive analytics provider AgilOne and web analytics vendor Webtrends.

News Round Up

Nothing To See Here, Folks

With Advertising Week around the corner and ad blocking seizing the public’s attention, IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg is trying to contain the circus. In a Q&A with Mike Shields of The Wall Street Journal, Rothenberg cautions that ad blocking mirrors “every crisis du Jour [sic] in our industry over the past 10 years,” and that “[t]he sky hasn’t fallen.” The IAB is evidently not giving up on legal action – “That might be a course of action. Maybe.” – but don’t hold your breath. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/A00y04WB200AyPq00L0A0DA> .

Living In The Past

Nielsen released its Q2 2015 Total Audience Report, underscoring the long road ahead for digital to overcome usage of traditional mediums (i.e., TV and radio). TV’s dominance is no big surprise, especially after 5-6 p.m., when people start getting home from work, but radio’s share of overall usage is greater than all digital channels combined from morning drive time straight through to the mid-afternoon. Mobile and desktop use is the most consistent throughout the day. Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWB400z0ABD0000yL02P0Aq> .

Snapchat’s Velvet Rope

Snapchat Discover – a suite of select publishers granted direct access to the app’s users – may be the hottest spot in the media world (replacing Michael’s in Midtown, as Fortune’s Erin Griffith puts it). Snapchat’s targeting and marketing isn’t best in class, but what it does have is exclusivity. When Snapchat adds media companies to Discover, they kick out others, creating intense competition to secure seats at the table with the app’s 100 million daily users. It also means the companies involved are deeply committed to satisfying Snapchat users. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/uC0000DB4L0A0A020PqWAy0> .

Challenging Ad Block Assumptions

Generic debates over “what works in mobile” and “how to address ad blocking” ignore the sharp differences between demographic groups. As eMarketer shows in an article posted Monday <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W000002Dy0L0B0BA4PDAq> , baby boomers are reticent to make purchases on their phones (unlike millennials). And boomers are also less receptive to mobile advertising. But! They lag deeply <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0yAAC0DE000>  behind younger users in ad-block adoption. It’s also worth bearing in mind that most ad-block users don’t care whether advertising is good/targeted/interruptive – they download anyway.

The Promise And Perils Of UGC

Brands are turning to user-generated content on social media for more of their marketing, which is bringing new attention to creative rights, brand best practices and social media policies. Platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest (Facebook is more restrictive) are gold mines for marketers to poach users’ photos and comments, but what expectations of privacy exist? And as Sydney Ember and Rachel Abrams from The New York Times ask, to what degree are Instagram/Pinterest/Twitter responsible for marketers repurposing posts beyond their platforms? Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/l0BqD000LyDP0A2A4000F0W> .

News Round Up

Is The Sun Rising Or Setting On Agencies?

Writing for Media Village, MediaLink founder Michael Kassan gives his guess at what’s to come of creative, media and tech agencies as their long-established roles become ever more juxtaposed with technology. Kassan writes, “My money is on shops becoming more like advisors,” with the current agency model shifting to a more consultative “consigliere” service. The competition for accounts is unprecedented, but we could see different sectors of the ecosystem join up (see: Truffle Pig), or new twists on the traditional agency model (i.e., Dentsu Aegis). Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/qxAW0A0DLq004V02B0Py00q> .

Cutting Back On Cord-Cutters

Some broadcast networks are pulling away from Netflix, as the incremental revenue it provides fails to make up for an accelerated loss of pay-TV subscribers. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes recently said, “We don’t want that money to replace the more money that someone else was paying us.” According to David Crow at the Financial Times, TV execs also see a streaming service like Hulu as less of a threat because it’s owned in part by Comcast, NBC and Walt Disney, who have TV’s best interests at heart. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/gz0D40L0q20xBA0AW000rVP> .

Facebook’s Window On The Web

Facebook said last year that it would start using web browsing data from its plugin network to enhance advertising. But it hasn’t moved forward with those plans - until now. Read the blog post. <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0sL0000VP02BAqDx0A40A>  Tom Simonite at the MIT Technology Review calls it “a new firehose of valuable and controversial personal data.” The connection between Facebook’s like button and the web has been controversial in Europe <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0BxA00tVD0AP00040> , so we’ll see how users and regulators react to the new protocol. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0VA0DB0WC2Lq00xA00u4P0> .

Barons Of Industry

Comparing the data-driven digital economy with the oil, railroads and manufacturing that transformed America’s capitalist system at the turn of the 19th century, Robert Reich writes at the Times that big tech has become far too powerful a player in the American system. Like the vertically integrated companies that owned factories, goods and transportation, companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are bordering on monopolistic. Will US and European regulatory bodies rein in the titans? Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0VWD0Lv000B4000xD> .

$ocial Renaissance

Social media ad budgets are rising sharply, but there’s still dispute over whether the medium is a sales driver vs. a brand/engagement play. Coca-Cola has previously released reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000w2040qAxLPDBVE0WA0>  showing social media had no measurable impact on sales, but Ad Age’s Jack Neff writes that leaders at Unilever see a lift. The article highlights digital’s established benefits (hypertargeting over TV’s blanket appeal), but it’s also worth noting the strides social media platforms have made in enabling commerce and products like buy buttons.

Although it’s likely that a “fair number” of consumers will use content blockers, Adam Grow, SVP of display at Rakuten Marketing, said he doesn’t think “it will reach considerable mass in countries that have moved to large data plans and fast wireless networks, largely due to inertia.”

News Round Up

Ad Blocking Is But A Stage

Apple’s momentous ad-blocking move <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPxx0Nq0AD00B4h020W0>  and any publisher carnage it creates are mere “collateral damage” in a greater war between Silicon Valley’s titans (Google, Facebook and Apple), writes The Verge’s Nilay Patel. Apple’s new iOS 9 release has been covered as an existential threat to mobile web browsing. But those publishers are just the pawns falling before the king, says Patel, who argues Apple’s aggression toward digital sites has nothing to do with publishers and everything to do with undercutting Google’s dominance.

100M Pinners

For the first time, Pinterest has revealed its monthly active user base, and it’s far larger than eMarketer’s latest estimate of 41.1 million by year’s end. With 100 million MAUs, Pinterest is ready to prove it’s worth that $11 billion market cap. The firm increased its focus on ads this year, and saw early success with its core product, Promoted Pins. But there’s still work to do. “Pinterest’s 100 million users are dwarfed by the user bases of some digital contemporaries it competes with for ad dollars,” write NYT’s Mike Isaac. “It is one-third the size of Instagram and Twitter, for instance, and it is an even smaller fraction of the nearly one billion users of WhatsApp and the more than one billion members of Facebook.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWN4xA00yL0PB0O2> . And, read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0zL0000NP02BAqDx0P40A> .

Running On Data

Under Armour has described itself as a tech company, which may seem strange because everyone knows it as a sports clothing manufacturer. But in the impending world of data and wearables, those two things are heavily intertwined. Shareen Pathak of Digiday takes a look at how Under Armour is building a network of customer loyalty data, fitness audiences and both traditional and mobile commerce to create a hybrid clothing/tech company. By purchasing social media networks dedicated to fitness, and partnering with Sports Authority, Under Armour hopes to build its own well-greased customer funnel.

A Takeover Is Brewing

Anheuser-Busch InBev has approached rival bev giant SABMiller for a proposed merger that would “bring together two of the country’s most prolific advertisers and create an advertising giant,” reports WSJ’s Suzanne Vranica. Anheuser, the 44th biggest ad spender in the US, shelled out $539 million for ads in America last year. SABMiller, the 55th largest spender in the US, spent $430 million. But as often happens with mega-mergers, the merged brewer would likely spend less overall. “The combined company will have more clout and will be able to purchase ads cheaper,” says Kantar Media CRO Jon Swallen.

News Round Up

PLYmedia Rebuttal

This week, former AppNexus CTO Mike Nolet accused PLYMedia of driving fraudulent traffic, and the mobile video platform was subsequently axed from MediaMath’s DSP. On Wednesday, PLYmedia co-CEO Avishay Raviv penned a LinkedIn post to clear the air. While Raviv takes responsibility for what he calls “abnormal traffic patterns,” he refutes the allegation that fraud is to blame. Duplicated ads were not served, he added, but were due to a design flaw that lacked protective measures to field cap requests. According to Raviv, PLYmedia is working to correct the malfunction.

The Story On Page One

Apple is shuttering its Newsstand app to make room for Apple News, Wired’s Bryan Derballa reports. “Apple News offers publishers another way to get their content (and ads) in front of you, but within the confines of an Apple-controlled user experience,” writes Derballa. The competition to host publishers’ content is heating up, as Facebook, Snapchat, Google and Twitter all bring their own solutions. But Apple’s betting on wooing publishers by letting them keep 100% of ad revenue sold on Apple News, whereas Facebook’s history of choking off organic reach could give publishers pause.

App Markets

Vungle is getting down with the private marketplace trend. The in-app video platform rolled out Vungle Premium on Wednesday, an effort to help brands reach their audiences within the most popular apps – which can be a moving target. Vungle will rank the apps within its network of 12,000 and make the results available through a tool it’s calling Vungle Billboard. “Top apps come and go, so it's been a challenge for brands to stay nimble and reach the right audience before users move on to another hit app,” Vungle CEO Zain Jaffer told AdExchanger.

News Round Up

MediaMath Shuts Down PLYMedia

MediaMath appears to have cancelled buying privileges for one of its clients, PLYMedia, after former AppNexus CTO Mike Nolet described mobile video fraud <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00x04H0WIDP0L0A00>  he attributed to PLYMedia. The arbitrage player was buying mobile video impressions using MediaMath’s DSP and reselling them on LiveRail and Adap.tv. MediaMath said it would tighten some of its anti-fraud policies, including modifying how many strikes a client can have before it’s out. The mobile video fraud perpetrated by PLYMedia is exactly the kind that would have users running to install ad blockers: It sucked up 7% of a monthly data allowance in a single impression. Read the blog post. <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000H25x0L0B0JA4PDAq> 

On The Up Side

Writing for Ad Age, Havas SVP of strategy Tom Goodwin looks on the bright side of ad blocking. The current mobile Internet ad experience is broken, says Goodwin, and Apple’s plan to bake ad blockers into its operating system is a chance to rethink mobile strategies. “Ad agencies need to get imaginative, publishers and media owners need to start respecting consumers' attention spans, and brands need to produce quality messaging and learn to attract and entertain,” he writes. The way forward could be investing in premium mobile ads, embracing native spots and working on new brand content like apps. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/g60D40L0q20xBA0AW000KHP> .

It makes a certain sense that ads running simultaneously across TV and social are more impactful than the sum of their parts. Adweek’s Christopher Heine highlights a couple of examples, such as social media ads that are automatically triggered by broadcast commercials in a local market, and tech vendors that specialize in measuring the relationship between TV promos and social media boost. The article also touches on a devious strategy: buying the social media parallel to a competitor’s TV spot in an attempt to co-opt the impact.

Reach For The Stars

Dubai-based Al Ahi Holding Group snapped up TheAudience on Tuesday, in a play to manage and develop digital stars. TheAudience’s bread and butter is connecting brands and advertisers with stars on social media. Following its sale, the company will act as “the connective tissue” between Al Ahi’s considerable tech, media and entertainment holdings. As influencer marketing and direct access to digital stars grows in importance for marketers, expect more media conglomerates to integrate firms like TheAudience.

News Round Up

The Price Of Programmatic

Ad Age’s Alexandra Bruell takes a look at the dark side of automation, namely the sticker shock. “Programmatic ad tech involves not just the ad inventory at the end, but a trail of fees and costs along the way to pay for expensive engineers and traders, data-management platforms, research and development and more,” Bruell writes. “It adds up to make programmatic buying more expensive than ordering print ad pages or TV commercials through insertion orders and other routine methods.” But the trade-off is efficiency and effectiveness, as automation ultimately delivers more valuable audiences. Digital advertising is a rapidly evolving arena, and marketers and agencies all have to pay to play. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/gq0D40L0q20xBA0AW000WzP> .

Catch 22

The Journal’s Suzanne Vranica takes a look at Pinterest’s search advertising aspirations. The challenge for Pinterest is proving it’s more than a digital scrapbooking site, and that its users rely on search. But that throws Pinterest into the ring with Google. “Pinterest will have to show the same kind of conversion rate that Google search does,” said 360i chief Sarah Hofstetter. “The mindset is there but the dream has to be realized.” As is, Google controls 72.4% of all US search ad spend, per eMarketer. Yet Pinterest’s lifeline could be its diversity of ad revenue, which also relies heavily on display. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0xXA0q0r0BAL0PDz2> .

Privacy, Easy As F-T-C

Re/code’s Mark Bergen interviews Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez on data security, consumer privacy and the FTC’s role in the changing digital privacy landscape. “We’re trying to ensure that companies are making truthful representations about their data practices and their privacy practices,” explains Ramirez. And, she adds, making sure companies take “reasonable actions” to address security on the ground floor of product development. When asked to share examples of companies getting privacy right, Ramirez deflected. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DxBqA0020P0WsAzY00> .

Video Alchemy

Interest in shoppable video, once considered a boon for what digital and mobile would do for commerce, is beginning to wane. Key players (including Google, Facebook and Adobe) are investing resources in the format, but the hype hasn’t paid off, according to TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000Z2040qAxLPDBzt0WA0> . Writing for CMO, Todd Wasserman dives into the ROI for shoppable video campaigns, and asks whether the format will join location-based check-ins “in the dustbin of once-promising technologies that never took off.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/GxB0Az20D04uW0AL0000P0q> .

Buy

Stripe, the buy-button partner to Twitter and Facebook, launched an API method dubbed Relay that lets developers offer in-app buying opportunities rather than redirecting users to mobile sites – where a sale is often lost. Relay shows up with some smart integrations, including InMobi (allowing buy buttons to permeate the mobile ad network space) and SAP, commerce platform to brands like Levi’s and Oakley. So what are the use cases? Remains to be seen, but Twitter is using Relay to let anyone easily sell within tweets. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/CBP0010vL0zW00AD2q0xA04> .

News Round Up

Yahoo Shakeout Claims Scott Burke, Kathy Savitt

The revolving door continues at Yahoo. Ad tech chief Scott Burke exited last month, replaced as head of ad platforms by Prashant Fuloria, as first reported by Re/code’s Kara Swisher and confirmed by AdExchanger. And Yahoo confirms media division head Kathy Savitt is departing. Savitt will join STX Entertainment to head up the production studio’s digital operations. “The lack of traction in reviving [Yahoo’s] core business, especially advertising, has begun to take its toll,” Swisher writes. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LvT2lADP0x00A0> .

Verizon Joins Walled Garden Gang

Digiday’s Garett Sloane takes a detailed look at Verizon’s data mining and advertising long game, and the telecom giant’s strategy allegedly includes a data lockdown. “Verizon has been notifying partners that they are cutting off agreements for their precision insights product,” said one unnamed source with knowledge of the situation. “It means that Verizon might only offer its targeting data through its own platform from now on.” With AOL and Millennial Media in its back pocket, Verizon is gunning for a seat at the table with Google and Facebook.

United Front

Google and Twitter are joining forces to launch their own version of Facebook’s Instant Articles. The offering, first noted by Re/code and rumored to debut this fall, will let publishers push news content to users on mobile devices. So how does it differ from Facebook’s efforts? Google and Twitter’s version won’t host publishers’ content directly, but rather will show a cached web page (think: a snapshot preview of the publisher’s content). That cache will carry with it any ads publishers originally sold next to the content. Potential ad revenue split is unclear, but tech firms’ message to Facebook is crystal: Together we stand.

Pitchapalooza Chips Start To Fall

Johnson & Johnson is moving its $1 billion US media business back to UM’s J3, an Interpublic Group agency. One year ago, J&J took its business from J3 to Omnicom’s OMD. “Consumer and customer insights and expectations for Johnson & Johnson brands are rapidly evolving regionally and globally,” a J&J spokeswoman told Ad Age. “In order to adapt to and exceed expectations, Johnson & Johnson continually evaluates the resources required to meet consumer and customer needs and support growth opportunities for our brands. ” The assignment includes brands like Neutrogena, Aveeno, Xarelto, Zyrtec, Listerine and Tylenol.

Aim For The Stars

Carat has big automation dreams, AdNews’  Pippa Chambers reports. The Dentsu Aegis media agency wants to be 100% digital and 40% programmatic by 2020, according to CEO Simon Ryan, with 60% of its media strategy underpinned by analytics that same year. “These predictions are based on the force of change that is currently occurring and the necessity of being more ROI focused,” Ryan said. “Data from clients, media and associated media, and client partners such as Quantium, will also see an increase in media that is automated and data to lead future-proof investment and drive ROI for clients.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4v0p0P00qD002LBW0XAx> .

Programmatic Ist Gut

In anticipation of dmexco, LiveRail checked in with The Trade Desk’s director of bizdev, Lukas Fassbender, on the state of programmatic in Germany. “There was a tipping point in mid-2014 when the market as whole began to be really interested in the programmatic market,” Fassbender said. “The availability of premium inventory has increased tremendously. There has been a huge surge in deals between agencies and publishers that are being executed programmatically.” But while premium inventory in Germany has increased, according to Fassbender, there’s still enough of a shortage to stall wider adoption.

See No Fraud, Hear No Fraud, Speak No Fraud

Industry leaders are chiming in on ad fraud with examples of their own. AppNexus co-founder Mike Nolet posted on LinkedIn about one network, PLYmedia, that appears to be racking up “views” of video ads that run in a loop in the background. PLYmedia then shuttles those fraudulent impressions between MediaMath and LiveRail or Adap.tv. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/yxvWDqP00A0LABZ04r00020> .

Within the industry, there’s no standardized way for publishers to alert vendors to problems with programmatic ads. VP Susan Parker can’t tell advertisers that a tag they’re running is so slow that the ad isn’t even being served 50% of the time.

News Round Up

IPO-No

It’s a rough year for tech firms hoping to exit. Research from Renaissance Capital suggests that a mere 11% of all US IPOs this year were held by tech companies, a seven-year low. To be clear, that percentage is not specific to advertising technology firms, but ad tech often falls under the same umbrella. “Many of these private valuations are ignoring the fundamental risks involved in achieving their projections,” Paul Bard, Renaissance’s direct of research, told The Wall Street Journal’s Rolfe Winkler. “I suppose as long as the big winners produce outsized returns to cover the losers, the party can continue. But the stakes are getting higher.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0x60B4L0N2AAP00q0Dm00> .

Programmatic Priorities

Programmatic buyers and sellers disagree on automation’s biggest value add, eMarketer reports. A July survey from Technorati suggests ad professionals on the sell side say first-look or exclusive access is programmatic’s biggest draw. But first-party data segments topped the list for buy-side ad pros. The survey itself is a bit of a moot point, since ad professionals from both sides agree on the inherent value of programmatic. But, as eMarketer points out, “Programmatic is evolving rapidly and growing pains have been part of the process for marketers and publishers alike, making such differences unsurprising.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00P7DmA40LxB00OA> .

Barone On Ad Blocking

Speaking to Beet.TV, GroupM ad ops chief Joe Barone weighs in on ad blocking. “We’ve reached a point where we can no longer say it’s not an issue in the US,” Barone said. “The real concern is targets like millennials, IT professionals, who are almost invariably using ad blockers,” he added. GroupM is working closely with the IAB, 4As and ANA on potential solutions, “some of which are directly content-related.” The problem could get worse before it gets better, with Apple’s iOS 9 exiting beta on Sept. 16, an operating system that will have baked-in ad-blocking tech.

Taming The Hydra

According to Bleacher Report GM Dorth Raphaely, digital publishing has a surfeit of channels, and “you have to be able to prioritize which platforms are going to be the most impactful.” Digiday’s Ricardo Bilton has a roundup of publisher opinions about what’s top-of-mind right now, and Marty Moe, president of Vox Media, echoed the same idea: “Different platforms require different approaches, whether that is a small tweak to a format or an entirely different way of telling a story.” Reporters and marketers are grappling with the same gigantic, fragmented ecosystem.

News Round Up

Over The Hill

In an interview with Adweek, Trilia Media President Cindy Stockwell opens up about what led Hill Holliday to spin off its media operations. Prior to her current role, Stockwell served as EVP and chief media officer for Hill Holliday. “We wanted to be able to invest in tools, technology and data sets to give our current clients an edge in the marketplace,” she said. “To do that, we needed to be in a position to create a revenue stream. We talked to a few key search consultants who felt that media creativity was really lacking in the rush to data and low CPM, and that clients were hungering for a partner that could provide both.” The line between media and creativity continues to blur. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0x0oWD0L4PE0A2q0j0BA00> .  

Dis-Integration

Speaking of agencies, Brian Jacobs asks in a think piece for Media Village what advertisers are looking for from agencies, and why agencies have been going through a period of recent “restlessness.” He posits that as holding companies try to provide an integrated service across their agencies, turf wars can result. “There’s a kind-of middle-path land-grab within which one holding company claims to be able to deliver an integrated service across its operating units. Sometimes this works; sometimes the agencies within the holding company fall out over who gets the largest slice of the cake.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DpA02000BWj0q4xFLP0A> .

WPP-Adobe, BFFs

WPP has cozied up to Adobe through an expanded strategic partnership. The team-up is designed to bolster marketing tech solutions available to WPP agencies such as Acceleration, Wunderman, KBM Group and VML. It falls under WPP’s Technology Partnership Program, spearheaded by Chief Digital Officer Scott Spirit. WPP chief Sir Martin Sorrell says the deal lets clients “respond more strategically and more efficiently to their biggest marketing challenges,” according to a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqGB0x2LW004D0P0AAq0j00> .

Clever As A Fox

National Geographic and 21st Century Fox are moving beyond their existing partnership – Fox already holds a majority stake in National Geographic’s broadcast properties – to start a new media company called National Geographic Partners. Unlike the National Geographic Society, this venture will be for-profit, and will encompass all of National Geographic’s properties (TV, print, digital, licensing, maps, etc.). The New York Times reports that the new company is valued at $725 million, with Fox owning 73% and National Geographic 27%. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0xHA0000q0Dr20LAWj> .

The AP API?

The Associated Press is launching a new division meant to “help brands promote their products and services through multiformat storytelling.” The AP currently works with brands through its AP Assignment service, which distributes content through its technology and infrastructure. The new AP Content Services group, like AP Assignments, is separate from the newsroom. Judging by the language in the release, the AP plans to facilitate work with its network of people who do production (“securing photographers and video crews”), but not to take on the content creation with its own talent.

News Round Up

Missed The Starting Gun 

Last week, AOL acquired Millennial Media to grow its mobile ad biz, but capturing mobile ad dollars is no easy feat. Google has cornered 32.9% of all US mobile ad spend (about $10.02 billion), while Facebook commands 19.4% ($5.2 billion), according to eMarketer. Millennial Media only takes 0.3% of total mobile ad spend in the US, or $101.2 million. To win at mobile, media firms need to offer advertisers scale, robust targeting and sophisticated reporting tools, says eMarketer analyst Cathy Boyle. With Millennial, Boyle says AOL gains ground in scale and targeting. But AOL has a lot of catching up to do. EMarketer expects Google will be the mobile leader through 2017, but Facebook's share of mobile ad spend will grow at a higher rate than Google’s.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PJB00000Ad4Dq02xWz0> More. 

Don’t Go Chasing Waterfalls 

Programmatic SSP Sovrn is breaking into the header bidding game with the release of its proprietary bidding tech. Game publisher Curse is the first to trial the auction. “Daisy chaining [or the publisher waterfall] is inefficient because it does not give a publisher full transparency into the fair market value of the publisher’s inventory,” Sovrn explained in a  <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0x0AWD0L4PK0A2q0d0BA00> press release. “This lack of transparency means publishers often lose revenue by unknowingly offering and then selling a specific ad impression to one advertiser, when another partner lower in the chain would have paid more.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0BxA00LdD0AP00040> Read on via MediaPost. 

Too Snappy? 

Some Snapchat advertisers have a problem with, well, ephemeral messaging. Advertisers are concerned that branded snaps are too often skipped or disappear too quickly, according to Digiday. One unnamed agency source claims 70% of users skip Snapchat ads within three seconds. “It’s a pretty big concern depending on the goals and what you’re buying the ads for,” said Orli LeWinter, VP of strategy and social marketing for 360i. “We tend to focus on video completions as the key metric, versus video views and clicks, because it shows the level of engagement and interest.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LdC2MADP0x00A0> More. 

There’s Fire And Kindle, But No Heat 

Amazon will debut a $50 tablet with a six-inch screen this holiday season, according to the Journal’s Greg Bensinger. But Bensinger’s  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00x0Dd0WNDP0L0A00> recent reporting indicates Amazon is pulling back from consumer tech products, an area where it “flamed out” in efforts to produce a popular smartphone. Amazon and Walmart have both dipped a toe in the device production pool, but their struggles shows how tough it is for outsiders to crack a market that’s thoroughly dominated by the likes of Apple and Samsung.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0EO02q0L0AB0Dx00Ad4> More. 

A Bazaar Approach 

Best Buy has seen success with its “intra-store storefronts” strategy, which give companies like Samsung, Apple and Microsoft dedicated space and signage within a Best Buy. Now, Best Buy is flipping the script. Macy’s revealed that it will license store space to Best Buy to sell tech products within the fashion retailer’s four walls. A pilot program to begin with, Macy’s is only bringing Best Buy into 10 locations through the holidays. But Fortune’s Phil Wahba notes that Macy’s recently introduced Men’s Wearhouse rental shops within 300 stores. Affiliate linking may somehow have jumped to brick-and-mortar retail.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PPB00000Ad4Dq02xWF0> Read on.

News Round Up

The Magic Of Clorox 

Clorox will spend three times more on programmatic ads this year than it did last year, the Journal’s Jack Marshall reports. At that rate, about half of Clorox’s full digital budget will go to automated buying. “Programmatic media has enormous potential. … I’d say our mix today reflects our confidence in it,” said CMO Eric Reynolds. “We could imagine our investment in it increasing.” On fraud and viewability, Reynolds isn’t worried. “We are now getting comfortable with ways to make sure our ads are being viewed by humans and are viewable,” he said. “The value for us as a marketer is impressive, so it’s worth going through these challenges.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0x0MWD0L4PR0A2q080BA00> Read it. 

Ad Blocking: Mountain Or Molehill? 

Lacking empirical studies on the effect of ad blocking (as opposed to fraud, where marketers can actually point to money that may as well have been set on fire), the industry overreacted to a report from Adobe and PageFair claiming publishers will lose $21.8 billion this year. BuzzFeed’s Alex Kantrowitz, citing a handful of tech/economics professors, reports that number is a “gross inflation” because the flood of inventory would lower prices. The impact is still substantial, but agencies and trading desks haven’t voiced panic about a missing audience.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqSB0x2LW004D0P0AAN0800> Read on. 

Nardone’s Take 

EMarketer interviewed John Nardone, CEO of ad server Flashtalking and former [x+1] chief. As advertisers take programmatic in-house and publishers move to co-opt their data, Nardone says the impetus is clear. “Advertisers do not want to be held hostage to Google’s and Facebook’s data,” he said. “The only way for them to not be held hostage in their view is to create their own data assets. Since no individual company tends to have everything, they’re looking for natural partners they can band together with to create enough value and scale so as not to be so dependent on Google and Facebook.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PTB00000A84Dq02xWO0> Read on. Pair with  <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0x0PWD0L4PU0A2q080BA00> AdExchanger’s recent Nardone Q&A. 

Power In Numbers 

Following intense censorship and a cyber attack linked to the Chinese government, Google abandoned China as a product hub. Now its foot is inching back through the door, reports Amir Efrati at The Information. Google is working with authorities to enable a more cohesive product (in line with its international apps, devices and browsers) that allows for censorship policies. As companies like WeChat and government-mandated fragmentation undercut Google in China, the reversal is a reminder that the authoritarian regime holds all the leverage with foreign tech players.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0QV02q0L0AB0Dx00A84> Read the full piece (subscription required).

Wearables offer the potential for marketers to harness “emotional” data. A brand, for example, could target people who slept four hours or less, offering them coffee drinks or sleep aids.

News Round Up

A Programmatic UK 

Programmatic display ad spend in the UK is slated to grow 66.2% and hit $2.96 billion this year, eMarketer reports. At that rate, programmatic will make up the majority (59%) of the country’s total display ad market. “It hasn't been an easy journey, but initial trepidation is being replaced with a realization that programmatic can deliver the inventory, partners and prices that marketers want," said eMarketer analyst Bill Fisher. Hold the phone for mobile. eMarketer predicts mobile programmatic display ad spend will account for 68% of all digital display spend this year and will hit 75.5% in 2016.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPxE02q0AD00B4D020W0> Read on. 

Hulu’s Nonissue 

The Journal’s Mike Shields follows up with advertisers on Hulu’s quasi ad-free streaming service, which surfaced on Wednesday. The consensus? Advertisers aren’t too bothered. “There aren’t that many people in the US that are going to shell out $12 a month to avoid ads,” said Kris Magel, CIO for media-buying firm Initiative. “I don’t believe this is going to wipe out their ad business.” Ditto Razorfish. “As far as the volume of premium content to run ads alongside, you’d be hard pressed to find a larger aggregator of that than Hulu,” said Brian Leder, Razorfish SVP for North America.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/qxAW0A0DLE004202B0PF00q> More. 

‘H’ Is For Hegemony 

Writing for TechCrunch, Sojern CEO Mark Rabe offers an insider’s look into how data and technology are upending the travel industry. In what Rabe describes as “World War H” (“H” as in “hotel”), Rabe writes that RTB, SDKs, DMPs, DSPs and online booking portals are intensifying competition over consumers. “In our war analogy, Google’s entry into the market may be the equivalent of a nuclear arsenal,” Rabe writes, adding that Google, “armed with more web traffic, more data on their users from which to determine the perfect offer and an infrastructure to manage millions of hotel clients profitably,” is uniquely positioned to corner the market.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0xF0B4L0G2AAP00q0D200> Read on. 

Now You See Me, Now You Don’t 

Digital-native companies like Vox, BuzzFeed and Mic should seemingly be panicking over ad blocking, which is disproportionately common among their younger audiences. But instead, Ad Age’s Tim Peterson reports that those companies have embraced branded content, from native ads to video production houses churning out sponsored videos. Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff thinks the risk (and blame) goes to ad tech companies, which slow down page loads and seed privacy concerns over user tracking.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PGBHD000qA2204L0x> Read more. 

All Over APAC 

Adknowledge Asia broke into two APAC markets on Thursday through the acquisition of Komli Media’s Southeast Asia operation. Adknowledge Asia is a joint venture between a subsidiary of Asian telecom firm Axiata and Adknowledge, a digital marketing tech firm. With existing teams in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Hong Kong and South Korea, Thursday’s acquisition gains Adknowledge access to Thailand and the Philippines. According to a press release, Adknowedge’s Axiata partnership “opens the door to responsibly monetizing telecom companies’ vast user data to serve more relevant and appropriate ads.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/yx2WDqP00A0LABI04H00020> More. 

The Product Pace 

Google’s been busy blogging about ads over the last two days, with three posts underlining the growing importance of connecting campaign metrics and strategies across marketing channels. Twin posts Tuesday and Wednesday announced that native Gmail ads and ads in the TrueView video format be can now be managed via AdWords. The most recent post demonstrates new tools for comparing and optimizing campaigns on the go – as well as how the interactions between channels impact the larger campaign.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DxBqA0020P0WJA2I00> More.

News Round Up

Snapping Up Ad Tech 

Delhi-based ecommerce newcomer Snapdeal acquired Silicon Valley ad platform Reduce Data for an undisclosed sum. The deal adds to the trend of ecommerce players beefing up their ads biz through acquisitions. (Snapdeal rival Flipkart’s bought AdIQuity Technologies, a mobile ad tech firm, in March.) Reduce Data’s team numbers 15, so the deal reads like an acqui-hire. Snapdeal says it was drawn to Reduce Data CEO Asif Ali for his experience “building highly specialized teams focused on a data platform and ad tech products.” Snapdeal has raised $1.6 billion to date and connects 40 million users to more than 200,000 retailers.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0P4B00000AY4Dq02wWa0> More via The Tech Portal. 

Interrupting Interstitials 

Once again, Google must negotiate a middle ground between its advertisers, its pockets and its users. According to Tom Maxwell at 9to5Google, the company will use its search algorithm to penalize sites that use app download interstitials. Evidently, Google is tired of users blaming platforms or browsers when they get sucked down an app download rabbit hole. Re/code’s Mark Bergen points out that although Google’s “mobilegeddon” caused a ruckus, sites have largely accepted the change and moved on.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0w5A0000q0Db20LAWY> Read more. 

Squashing Ads, Taking Names 

Hulu released an alternative subscription service that’s ad-free – well, almost. The subscription package, which goes for $12 per month, erases all ads with the exception of select shows from ABC and Fox, both of which will host 15-second pre-roll and a 30-second post-roll ads. According to Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins, the reason for allowing some ads on the otherwise ad-free subscription tier has to do with studio’s rights over select series. “They have other commitments that they couldn’t free them up for a complete commercial-free offering,” he explained.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bw006W2A000040YB0DcLPqA> Read more via Variety. 

Bird’s Eye View 

Twitter has taken flak over the years for intermittently disregarding marketers. One of things it probably should have done sooner was announced on Wednesday, as it unlocked promoted tweets for 167 countries that had previously not hosted native ads. Bloomberg reporter Sarah Frier says the move could provide a decent revenue boost, considering the US accounts for more than 60% of revenue, despite “a vast majority” of users being overseas.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00w0dY0W7DP0L0A00> More. 

The Bronze Lining 

With the countdown on for mobile ad spend to outpace desktop, the Journal’s Steven Perlberg looks at the waning of desktop advertising since its peak in 2013. Though it’s now widely accepted that mobile will outgrow desktop, this does put to rest some of the theories floated in the not-so-distant past that mobile’s effect on digital would be essentially additive. Desktop may be a long way from fossilized, but there is fall-off.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/m000082040qAwLPDBYe0WA0> Read on.

News Round Up

Mobile Rising 

Mobile ad spend will outpace desktop spending for the first time in 2015, according to eMarketer. After releasing a more modest estimate in March, eMarketer now expects mobile advertising will grow by 59% this year. Mobile’s share of the overall US ad market, at 16.6%, will also surpass print’s share, at 15.8%. "Consumers' increasing on-demand consumption of media through mobile—coupled with improvements in targeting, attribution and ROI for mobile advertising—will continue to take away ad dollars from magazines and newspapers," said eMarketer analyst Martín Utreras.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/lTBqE000LwDP0A2A4000P0W> More. 

Bazaarvoice Misses On Programmatic 

Speaking to investors, Bazaarvoice CEO Gene Austin said the firm’s seen “less than desired” programmatic revenues in Q1. "Our programmatic revenue was less than expected in Q1, as our retail publishers moved to stricter control on advertiser access utilizing a white list approach which resulted in lower sell-through rates and clearing prices," he said. Bazaarvoice connects brands to consumers through user-generated content and via targeted media. Total ad revenue for the quarter was $2.1 million, a 24% increase year over year. Austin said the firm expects its programmatic revenues will continue to struggle in Q2.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/FwDBL00QF0W0P2Tq000AA04> Seeking Alpha has the transcript. 

Targeting The Tube 

Addressable TV companies are trying to get the industry to shake the old TV mindset, which states that TV is great for reach and message, but lacks precision targeting. Adweek’s Jason Lynch reports on the transition by many broadcasters to digital streaming, with Scripps (featuring HGTV, Travel Channel and the Food Network, among others) as the most recent to ford the river. Matt Smith of Anvato, the live-streaming company powering Scripps’ service, says of TV programmers and ad players, “I don’t think [they] understand how granular an ad we can deliver.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0RwA00GTD0AP00040> Read on. 

My Social, Myself? 

Writing for Digiday, Google’s head of creative in New York, Rudi Anggono, claims relying on social data alone can paint an inaccurate picture of the consumer. A number of factors inform likes, comments and shares, he writes, which means those actions don’t always reveal a user’s true tendencies. “Whether you’re a marketer, a political strategist, an agency planner or an intern researching a paper, you can’t trust data based on what people tell you,” he said. “You have to prod, extrapolate, look for the intent, play good cop bad cop, get the full story, get the context, get the real insights. Use all the available analytical tools at your disposal.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/lTBqH000LwDP0A2A4000S0W> Read it.

Market Volatility Raises Questions For <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0wqW0D00jAAB0N4PA>  Pre-IPO Ad Tech Firms
The ad tech companies most likely to exit will be at-scale firms with differentiated capabilities and proven profit margins, said Mediaocean CEO Bill Wise. IPO candidates should also have a strong, recurring revenue stream versus revenue generated by sales insertion orders, he said.

Data-Driven Thinking column...DMP 1-2-3 by Chris O'Hara, Krux Digital <http://go.adexchanger.com/JB2LWq0EwA00nND0AP00040> 
The truth is that data management technology can be much simpler than you think. At its most basic level, DMP comes down to “data in” and “data out.”

News Round Up

“Out-Stream” Picks Up Steam 

The Journal’s Mike Shields takes a look at companies carving out a niche in “out-stream video ads.” Although mobile sites are transitioning to feed-style formats, text-heavy web pages are still the norm and the industry is struggling to find more effective formats. Virool and Teads are two firms putting video ads directly on mobile sites. The ads only play when a user scrolls over the format (and marketers only pay for viewed videos). So far, out-stream ads are commanding prices at four times traditional mobile formats, according to Rubicon Project.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40J0A2N0BsLD0WwP00q0A0> More. 

Here Today, Gone Tomorrow 

Google purportedly shuttered operations on an under-wraps project dubbed “Google Here,” Fortune reports. The project would have used beacons to send push notifications to Android users when a consumer is on site at a partner location. The thinking behind Google Here is what some developers call “app-less distribution,” or enabling businesses to speak to mobile users who haven’t installed a dedicated app. But according to Fortune’s sources, the project was shut down for being borderline “invasive.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00DKA02000BWN0q4wtLP0A> More. 

Network Blockade 

In case you thought otherwise, TV networks are not immune to ad blockers. Internet users with ad blocking software are eliminating pre- and mid-roll ads on NBC’s, ABC’s and Fox’s digital properties, Ad Age reports. It’s unclear how big of an impact networks face from ad blockers, but some networks are running tests to assess the damage. “The trend in ad blocking is a concern for all publishers – video, display or any others," said David Morris, CRO for CBS Interactive. "We need to address this as an industry."  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000N2Lw0L0B0uA4PDAq> Read on. 

You Down With PMP? 

Hulu’s announcement last week that it would evolve to a private marketplace (PMP) model – as opposed to an open RTB exchange – was an important step in an industrywide trend toward PMPs, writes Ronan Shields via The Drum. Publishers initially afraid of “cannibalizing revenue generated by their direct sales” are apparently hungry enough to reconsider. Companies like AppNexus and Rubicon Project have also made pricey acquisitions in a pivot to this new breed of “programmatic direct.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ywNWDqP00A0LABM04v00020> Read on. 

Sandoval Exits 

LiveIntent COO Jerry Sandoval is stepping down, the email marketing firm revealed Monday. In a companywide email shared with AdExchanger, Sandoval wrote, “Engineering and Product are being left in the capable hands of Dave [Hendricks] and Tom [Buoniello], who will now report directly to Matt [Keiser]. Audrey [Maclsaac] will continue to lead business operations, which I will continue to support through the transition over the next few months.” Sandoval will stay on until Dec. 1. Read CEO Matt Keiser’s  <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWN400w0ABD00N0wL02P0Aq> blog post about the departure. 

Developers Ready To Go Over The Top 

Writing for Fast Company, Jared Newman says that many of the people working on Apple TV’s new apps (of which there are about 60) are struggling with the company’s rigid guidelines for third-party developers. With expectations of a shiny new Apple TV product, including a rumored touchscreen remote, developers are rearing to escape Apple’s “tight leash.”  <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0wAAx0DON00> More. 

One Fish Two Fish 

Razorfish snapped up 2DataFish, a Sydney-based data and analytics consultancy certify to support Adobe Analytics implementations. It’s a reminder of how many agencies are securing their futures by tethering to the big ad platform companies. “This move positions us to accelerate growth in the Australian market … through the addition of world-class talent, data analytics and customer intelligence capabilities, technology platforms and intellectual property,” said Michael Karg, Razorfish Global’s international CEO. For now, 2DataFish will maintain a separate brand name.  <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000N2Pw0L0B0yA4PDAq> Read the release.
