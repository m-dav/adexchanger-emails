 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

PulsePoint Eyes An Exit 

PulsePoint may be courting buyers, according to The Deal Pipeline’s sources, with an asking price of $400 million or more. PulsePoint was created through the merger of ContextWeb and Datran Media. Its current VC backers include SpaceX, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Investor Growth Capital, Updata Partners and VantagePoint Capital. “My sense is that those companies always wanted to be and planned to be acquired," said an anonymous source. “A lot of these ad tech companies don't have recurring revenue models.” But CEO Sloan Gaon says revenues are nearing $100 million. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/O0P0P4qA02000WLK0i0AjDB> . 

Programmatic Perspective 

Speaking to The Drum, Rockabox chief James Booth says programmatic is not taking revenue so much as it’s permeating the market. “With each emerging area, we should recognize that often it’s programmatic entering the arena where budgets exist as much as budget shifting to programmatic,” Booth said. “Obviously if budget shifts to linear TV bought programmatically, it helps the vertical of programmatic, but the main consideration should be on the performance and return; get those elements right and the spend will follow.” Rockabox specializes in programmatic tech for rich media and video content.

Deep-Linking Cash 

Branch Metrics, a deep-linking startup that works with apps like AlltheCooks, Gogobot and Personal Capital, raised $15 million on Thursday to scale its business, The Wall Street Journal reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/GjB0AP20Dk4MW0AL0000P0q> . As users spend more time in apps – 89% of total time spent on mobile devices last year, per Nielsen – Branch and other deep-linking startups like Quixey and URX are drawing attention from developers and investors. The startup’s database contains more than 20 million links embedded in apps, a number it projects will grow to 100 million within three months. In September, Branch snagged $3 million in VC cash.

Green Light For Net Neutrality 

Thursday’s victory for net neutrality proponents <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWO400m0ABD00P0jL02P0Aq>  may have a silver lining for video providers like YouTube and Netflix, according to Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/qjAW0A0DLn004P02B0PP00q> . “If I come up with a really awesome video-distribution service that runs over BitTorrent, for example, I don’t have to worry about my ISP shutting off BitTorrent in favor of Netflix,” said Jeremy Gillula, a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “[Net neutrality] allows people to use the Internet in a very flexible way, and it’s not going to be dictated by what American ISPs think they can get the most money out of.” 

Searching For Installs 

Google shared plans to pilot a sponsored search results program on Google Play. “Search ads on Google Play will enable developers to drive more awareness of their apps and provide consumers new ways to discover apps that they otherwise might have missed,” Google  <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLPWQ0APjo020qD40> explained in a blog post. In the weeks to come, a select number of users will begin to see ads from a small pool of advertisers who are already using Google search ads for their apps, Google added. “We’ll have more to share in the coming months about the expansion of this program as we look at the results and feedback. We believe search ads will be a useful addition to Google Play for users and developers alike.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Google’s Stronghold 

In an interview with Beet.TV, Jay Vanderzee, Google’s media platform sales head for the Americas, shed some light on DoubleClick’s scale, as well as Google’s future focus on TV. The number of transactions occurring on Google’s DoubleClick Ad Exchange now supersedes every stock exchange in the world combined, according to Vanderzee. “This type of transaction is now so large at this point, I find it hard to believe we’re ever going to go backwards,” he said. “We’re just at the beginning of the data revolution.” On TV, Vanderzee revealed, “We believe that the consumer is watching multiple different screens, so we have to focus on how to make a multiscreen ad platform work properly for advertisers. There are a lot of challenges that go into that, but simplifying the process of measurement and attribution ultimately is what’s on our road map.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/iBJW00BjP9L00A000Dq2A04> . Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal’s Rolfe Winkler says (subscription) <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LJa2CADP0j00A0>  Google’s YouTube has lots of revenue, but no profits. 

TV Targeting Heats Up 

Programmatic TV buying platform AudienceXpress and TV researcher Rentrak paired up to strengthen marketers’ TV targeting game. Rentrak’s set-top and shopping data will couple with AudienceXpress’ ad serving tech for local and national cable networks. Rentrak chief Bill Livek said, “CEOs, CMOs all have this relentless pursuit of productivity. They need to cut costs and need better data and targeting. That’s why you’re seeing all these new automation platforms take hold.” Read on via The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DjBqA0020P0WbAJD00> . WPP took a 17% stake in Rentrak last October. 

Bloomberg Identity Crisis 

Speaking to Digiday, Bloomberg CEO Justin Smith argues that platforms, not publishers, are winning at media. “It’s interesting that traditional publishers always complain about the platforms taking away eyeballs and not sharing,” mused Smith. “The reason for their complaint is quite simple: These platforms have done a better job at media than media themselves. They’ve created better media content mousetraps. They are to a large extent wiping the table on digital advertising solutions that are measurable and data-driven.” Platisher is the new black.

Taboola’s Publisher Win 

Taboola will enter into a multiyear deal with the McClatchy newspaper chain to paste its content-recommendation widget on the publisher’s local news web and mobile properties, of which there are 30. Taboola founder and CEO Adam Singolda claims the deal marks a shift in the local digital ad market, which he says has been slower to adopt native strategies than national players. “We haven't seen a huge shift in local buyers buying native ads," Singolda told the New York Business Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00j0dJ0WFDP0L0A00> . "It's a completely different budget. We don't have any conflict between the different budgets of the local advertisers and the storytelling advertisers." The deal echoes Outbrain’s multiyear partnership with publisher Rodale, inked on Monday, and the content rec firm’s Wednesday deal with Le Monde <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDBG000AJj0A200WL4qPe00> . 

Ensighten’s App Module 

Tag management firm Ensighten unveiled an App Experience Optimization module on Wednesday. The offering will be baked into Ensighten Mobile to give marketers more flexibility on mobile and native apps. “As we look at the way consumer behavior is shifting, it’s clear apps will serve as the basis for much of the consumer activity across devices,” Ensighten chief Josh Manion said. “App Experience Optimization paves the way for real-time marketing agility in an app-driven world.” Ensighten’s clients include United Airlines, Getty Images, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Vivint.

Sustainable Cloud Growth 

On its Q4 earnings call, Salesforce.com chief Marc Benioff said the cloud CRM company "couldn't be happier about how all of our clouds are doing," given the company surpassed $5 billion in annual revenue. However, there are questions about long-term sustainable growth of its Marketing Cloud. Revenues were $140.4 million in Q4, a 46% increase year over year. Marketing Cloud revenue for the year was $505 million. In Salesforce.com's 2014 annual report, it noted its CRM application service remains its largest growth driver. Newer cloud products, Marketing Cloud and the mobile Salesforce1 Platform, specifically, signify new markets for Salesforce.com, but "it is uncertain whether our efforts will result in significant revenue for us."

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Acxiom Reshuffles AOS 

Acxiom is ditching its Audience Operating System title and rolling the ad data tool and LiveRamp’s tech into a single offering. The new system, dubbed LiveRamp Connect, debuts on Thursday and will offer tools to onboard offline data into programmatic exchanges, media platforms and mobile and addressable TV targeting channels. “We have merged the lines of code into a single offering,” explained Acxiom CEO Scott Howe. “In some respects the LiveRamp brand is more descriptive and more powerful than AOS.” Acxiom has also restructured its sales division, merging the former AOS sales group with LiveRamp’s team. Acxiom bought LiveRamp last May to the tune of $310 million. Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/gS0D40L0q20jBA0AW000dCP> . 

Foursquare Revenue Growth 

Speaking at VentureBeat’s Mobile Summit in California on Tuesday, Foursquare CRO Steven Rosenblatt shed some light on the location sharing and business discovery app’s growth. “I can share that we’ve had triple-digit revenue growth each year for the last three years,” he said, adding that Foursquare’s revenue comes from ads, data licensing and subscription fees from merchant partners. Foursquare has been racking up user data since it first emerged five years ago, and now boasts a user base of 55 million. “We are monetizing this incredible amount of data,” Rosenblatt said. “I think what marketers see is we’re able to give them insights that no one else can give them.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0jAAe0DTC00> . 

Facebook’s Advertiser Milestone 

Facebook’s active advertisers hit 2 million on Tuesday, a 33% jump from the 1.5 million active advertisers it counted in July. Facebook counts active advertisers as those that have placed an ad on the platform within the last 30 days. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg told Reuters <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPjU0Cq0AD00B4f020W0>  that the majority of its advertisers are SMBs, and that those marketers spend $5 to $50 per day on average. In tandem with the client milestone, Facebook released an Ads Manager app that aims to help businesses manage their Facebook ads via a mobile device. The app offers performance tracking tools, ad editing and creation tools, push notification opt-in and controls to adjust budgeting and scheduling. Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000g2040qAjLPDBCV0WA0> . 

Promoted Pinwheel 

Pinterest may be developing a “multi-pin carousel,” the next evolution of its spin on native ads, Promoted Pins. The format would let marketers rotate out the images within one promoted pin. Details are still forthcoming, but Pinterest spokesman Mike Mayzel told Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/K00q4WB00LCW2hADP0j00A0> , “We are always exploring ways to make pins more useful, including promoted pins. A multi-pin format is one example of the many things we are testing.” Pinterest’s monetization push comes as the social scrapbooking site aims to raise $500 million in VC funding at a $11 billion market cap, The Wall Street Journal reported last week <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bj00iW2A000040CB0DXLPqA> . Separately, eMarketer released a report <http://go.adexchanger.com/GjB0AC20Dj4YW0AL0000P0q>  that dissects Pinterest’s usage, marketing, advertising and ecommerce potential, and questions whether or not the platform can stack up to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter over time.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Calling Out Fraud Enablers… Or Not 

Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG), a joint anti-fraud venture created by the IAB, the 4As and the ANA, has yet to put any fraud offenders in the “penalty box,” as promised in November. According to a study by the ANA and White Ops, the industry stands to lose $6.3 billion to fraud this year if continued unfettered. But according to TAG CEO Linda Woolley, it’s too soon to tell who the offenders are. “In six months we’ll be able to identify pretty clearly who is doing what and whether they’re doing what they say they’re doing,” Woolley told Ad Age <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0PwBjD000qA2u04L0j> . In the meantime, TAG has launched an anti-piracy initiative and is building a registration system to bolster transparency between participating firms. 

Recommending Rodale 

Rodale and Outbrain struck a multiyear deal on Monday as part of a mobile-centric redesign of Prevention.com. The deal will also span Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Runner’s World and Bicycling. “As we pursue an aggressive digital strategy, launching new products and producing more content across our brands, Outbrain's … products will enable us to provide an increasingly personalized experience to our users,” said Beth Buehler, Rodale SVP of digital operations. Across its owned properties, Rodale hosts a combined 50 million-plus monthly uniques. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/gk0D40L0q20jBA0AW000xuP> . As The Wall Street Journal points out, Rodale will focus on driving traffic to its own pages and steer clear of referring users to other sites. 

2015: Media Spend Gets Spendier 

Big brands will increase their overall media budgets in 2015 and spend more on digital, according to JP Morgan's analysis. About 75% of the brands surveyed will boost their marketing budgets in the automotive, beverages, tech, software, health care and telecommunications sectors. “Native ads and video on smartphones should attract the most new online dollars, with Facebook, Google, and ultimately Twitter as key beneficiaries,” reads the report. “Twitter, whose advertising originated more from brand marketers than DR advertisers, will likely become an increasingly important form of engagement for brands given the ability to communicate with consumers in real time and now to utilize video more effectively on the platform.” Read on via MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0jqW0D00yAlB0u4PA> . 

Superfish Cont. 

Over the weekend, Facebook security researcher Matt Richard reported that the HTTPS-breaking tech uncovered in Lenovo's adware fiasco can be linked to a dozen more apps. The malicious code used in the Superfish ad-injecting software preinstalled on a number of Lenovo computers originates from Israeli firm Komodia, and could pose additional security breaches, according to Richard. The presence of Komodia’s tech means attackers could “potentially obtain that CA file and perform ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacks on untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi, set up authentic-looking phishing pages, or sign software that makes people vulnerable to other malicious code as they browse the internet,” he writes.

Data Accuracy Doubts 

Marketers are questioning the accuracy of targeting data purchased from third-party providers, The Wall Street Journal reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0nA02q0L0AB0Dj00Au4> . Targeting data is used more often for branded campaigns than for direct-response ones, according to Merkle's Megan Pagliuca. That makes data tracking and verification more difficult. Varick Media President Paul Rostowski adds, “There are lots of disparities out there between providers. If you’re doubling your costs by adding in data, the performance has to be at least twice as good. Often the cost of the data won’t justify itself.” Still, marketers believe the quality of third-party data will improve over time as vendors add more data points to their segments.

Mobile Wallet Arms Race 

Google Wallet payments will be preinstalled on Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T Android devices beginning later this year, thanks to a deal inked by Google and Softcard Technology on Monday. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/GjB0Au20DC4pW0AL0000P0q> , Google said it will also acquire some unspecified tech and intellectual property from Softcard to improve its mobile wallet offering. Re/code reporter Jason Del Rey points out that, if successful, the move could help Google connect the dots between mobile payments and advertising potential. The deal, he writes, “could give Google data on brick-and-mortar transactions, which still comprise the vast majority of all commerce and could be used to better target advertising to consumers.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWq400D0ABD00u0jL02P0Aq> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

WPP’s Competitive Edge 

In an interview with Beet.TV, Xaxis Chairman David Moore once again defends the holding company’s media buying/selling model. Xaxis is not a trading desk, he insists, it’s a media company. “The time and materials model has become an antiquated way of doing business in the media world,” he says, pointing out that other agency holding companies are starting to follow suit (*cough* Omnicom). Next, Moore outlines how WPP’s $25 million stake in AppNexus fits into its overall strategy “DSPs are going to become commodities,” he said. “The real competitive advantage comes from how you manipulate data and use it. We don’t want to invest in infrastructure anymore, we want to invest in competitive advantage.” Watch the interview <http://go.adexchanger.com/dA0LPjj0oq0AD00B4q020W0> . 

NYT Mag Ad Makeover 

In anticipation of The New York Times Magazine’s Sunday relaunch, Capital New York got to the heart of the publication’s ad strategy in a 60-second interview with publisher Andy Wright. “We have 121 advertising pages – 42 new advertisers representing 17 categories of business,” said Wright. “A single advertiser, eBay, bought 100 percent of the digital inventory for the launch issue, and that is a first.” NYT Mag is also interested in expanding traditional print formats into digital formats like podcasts and video, according to Wright. “You'll see new full bleed ad units in digital [and] for the first time, advertisers can sponsor entire digital issues of the magazine,” he added. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/FjDBL00kr0W0P2oq000AA04> . 

YouTube For Kids 

On Monday, Google debuts a kid-friendly version of its Android app that will host both ads and original content. The simplified redesign will show only approved content, with National Geographic Kids, Thomas & Friends and LeVar Burton’s Reading Rainbow as early YouTube channels to be included. But youth advertising is a tricky market, and Google will curate which ads appear in the app through an internal approval process. Clicking through to an advertiser’s site will be disabled, and as an added precaution, Google tested the app with several children’s advocacy organizations, like Common Sense Media and the Family Online Safety Institute. Ad Age has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DjBqA0020P0WlAos00> . 

Mobile’s Exponential Growth 

Investors threw more than $32 billion into mobile tech companies in 2014, according to research advisory firm Digi-Capital. The 68 most valuable mobile firms (valued at $1 billion or more) tacked on $28 billion to their combined value in Q4 2014 to total $261 billion, according to the data. By 2017, Digi-Capital estimates that revenue generated from the mobile web will surpass $700 billion, more than tripping 2014’s figures. Read on via VentureBeat <http://go.adexchanger.com/GjB0Ao20Dt4mW0AL0000P0q> . Meanwhile, the former CMO of mobile ad network Jumptap (acquired by Millennial Media in 2013) <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0oWD0Lu000B4000jn> , Paran Johar, sold his Mobile Media Summit business last week with an eye on global expansion, says a press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ao0v04WB200AjPq00L0o0DA> . 

Audio Innovation 

Marketers are testing new approaches to digital radio through sponsored hours and branded content, eMarketer reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0po0Lj0DB0w0W0q4P20A0A> . Advertisers like Sony PlayStation, Anheuser-Busch and Procter & Gamble are testing an “owned” hour of listening time on Pandora, for instance, where users experience an hour of ad-free streaming by engaging with an ad at the beginning of the listening segment. “We are looking at all radio-type advertising as audio,” said Ed Gold, advertising director at State Farm. “When I look at my overall budget—that which used to be called the radio budget but is now called the audio budget—we are going where the consumer is, so if more consumers are going to digital radio, we are following them.”

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Lenovo’s Superfish Fiasco 

Security researches uncovered that Lenovo has been selling PCs preinstalled with adware called Superfish, which hijacks encrypted web sessions and puts browsers at risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Superfish forges certificate information, according to Ars Technica <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4f020P00qD002LBW04Aj> , and was purportedly being used to serve targeted ads. In a statement <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q0fA0DB0W52Lq00jA0034P0> , Lenovo said it ceased preloading the software in January and will not preload Superfish in the future. “The relationship with Superfish is not financially significant; our goal was to enhance the experience for users,” reads the statement. “We recognize that the software did not meet that goal and have acted quickly and decisively.” 

Programmatic Reality Check 

Google’s “aspirational” talk about programmatic video has yet to align with the reality of the ecosystem, according to a feature by The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Shields <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4f040P00qD002LBW06Aj> . Though publishers showed interest in Google Partner Select when the Internet giant revealed the offering in January, interest has stalled, according to analysts. “Right now, while there’s a huge amount of interest in programmatic video, getting a significant amount of ad inventory that way is the exception rather than the rule,” said eMarketer analyst Lauren Fischer. “Many publishers tend to hoard their video ad inventory to sell themselves, and some are dragging their feet [when it comes to trying programmatic vehicles]." That said, eMarketer predicts that 40% of digital video ad spend ($3.84 billion) will flow through programmatic channels by 2016. 

Digital Video Consolidation Rising 

Speaking to LUMAscape architect Terry Kawaja, The Drift’s Doug Weaver asks about rising consolidation in the digital video space. “We’ve seen 29 transactions across the Video LUMAscape just in the last 18 months starting with AOL/Adap.tv,” said Kawaja, pointing out that transactions include content grabs (Disney and Maker, Amazon and Twitch, AT&T and Fullscreen) and monetization plays (Comcast and FreeWheel, Facebook and LiveRail, Yahoo and BrightRoll). “These deals are reflective of the continued growth in digital video but also the coming convergent TV sector,” said Kawaja. He noted Facebook’s “staggering” growth in video, which saw more views than YouTube in October. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/b0000ABLfW70APj5020qD40> . 

Internet Radio Ad Loads 

On Thursday, XAPPmedia surfaced its report that analyzes how four major Internet radio services managed and filed ad inventory during and directly following the 2014 holiday shopping season. (XAPPmedia did not name the services.) On average, Internet radio firms are serving 2.69 minutes of ads per hour, which is less than one-third of hourly ad time listeners get on broadcast radio. “Broadcast radio has attempted to maximize revenue by continually increasing ad loads,” XAPPmedia CMO Bret Kinsella told AdExchanger. “But Internet radio providers are trying to create a specific type of consumer experience. That is going to constrain inventory, which means that for them to grow revenue, they have to focus on increasing ad rates.” Get the report <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0j00fq68> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Facebook, Viewability Sheriff 

Facebook is teaming up with the Media Rating Council, Nielsen, the IAB and a handful of brands and agencies to develop mobile and in-feed viewability standards, Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/gx0D40L0q20jBA0AW000o8P> . The coalition aims to have a working set of standards penned by the fourth quarter of 2015. "Our view, at least for right now, is to make sure the ad comes into view. Then once it's in view, do you have a minimum requirement in time or size?" explained Facebook's VP for measurement and insights, Brad Smallwood. But that’s where Facebook differs with the MRC, who last year defined viewability as 50% in-view for at least two seconds. Will the industry bend to Facebook’s in-view will? Related: Smallwood talks with AdExchanger about Facebook’s viewability policy <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqhB0j2LW004D0P0AAq0800> . 

Pinterest At CODE/Media 

Speaking at the CODE/Media conference on Wednesday, Pinterest partnerships head Joanne Bradford talked up the company’s unique paid media proposition. “What we've found with the Pinterest launch of ads is that people actually like ads and save them,” she said. “And advertisers got 30 percent free media with their campaigns just on an earned basis, from passing it around, it'd be like I gave you a page of a magazine and you gave it to more people.” Pinterest’s platform hosts more than 30 billion pins on more than 750 million boards, and two-thirds of that content belongs to businesses. Read on at CNBC <http://go.adexchanger.com/A80p04WB200AjPq00L0y0DA> . 

Medium Chief: MAU Must Go 

Blogger and Twitter/Medium co-founder Ev Williams thinks Internet companies and investors have a metrics problem. “I think a lot of the Internet and tech coverage of the Internet focuses on a distorting number of metrics … primarily users or monthly active users,” Williams said at the CODE/Media conference. “We don’t want to trick ourselves into optimizing for the wrong thing. … A better measure is the time people spend on these story pages.” TechCrunch has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0jq0B4L0z2AAP00q0D800> . This metrics debate comes as Williams bullishly positions Medium at a “Platisher.” Read Kara Swisher grill him about that via Re/code <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D008A0ALAWPrjB02q000> . 

Brands Budgets 

Data from a Duke University survey of 288 chief marketing execs suggests that mobile advertising now takes up 3.2% of brands’ overall marketing budgets, and that figure will nearly triple in the next three years to 9%. According to the findings, digital marketing spend will jump 14.7% in the next year, while traditional ad budgets will dip by 1.1%. Overall marketing budgets will grow 8.7% in 2015, the largest YoY forecast since 2012. "Compare that to the [.5] percent growth that they expected in February '09, and their confidence in markets is very clear," said Christine Moorman, research director and professor at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.

Rovi’s TV Platform 

A&E is first in line to trial a new TV targeting platform from Rovi. Ad Optimizer, as it’s called, is not an addressable ad system, though it does pull data from a number of sources to target audiences based on a programmer’s ad inventory. “We really tried to coexist with the TV ecosystem rather than try to change the TV ecosystem … and leverage additional data sets to understand the true target audience for an advertiser,” said John Hoctor, Rovi GM for analytics. “There’s a lot of pressure from advertisers and their agencies to understand with more granularity what the audience characteristics are of the placements that are being made.” Though the platform’s not programmatic, advertisers can plug their own automated solutions into Ad Optimizer, Hoctor added. Multichannel has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/a0200L0jqW0D00tACB084PA> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Twitter Power 

Software developers use Twitter’s Answer analytics tool to power 5 billion sessions a day, Wired reports. The tool, which competes with Flurry and Google Analytics, allows developers to learn how consumers use the product and track audience growth. Though only seven months old, the tool gives Twitter a foothold into apps beyond those it already owns. More diverse advertising options may follow. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0c20Lj0DB0X0W0q4P20A0A> . And in other Twitter-related news, Digiday’s John McDermott responds to The Atlantic’s Monday story claiming that Twitter didn’t drive visits to publisher sites <http://go.adexchanger.com/R00L4DjBqA0020P0WdA2Y00> . Without refuting the publisher-centric criticisms, McDermott points out, “For all the hand-wringing, there is one undoubtedly positive trend taking place on Twitter: The world’s most notable brands are deriving more value from it.” Read it on Digiday <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0eZ02q0L0AB0Dj00A24> . 

Snapchat Snaps Up Cash 

Shortly after the launch of Snapchat’s publisher platform, Discover, Bloomberg reports that the app, which traffics highly ephemeral messages, is raising $500 million against a $16 billion to $19 billion valuation. That range would put Snapchat behind just two other startups: Uber and Xiaomi. In 2013, Snapchat turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook and raised money last year under a $10 billion valuation. Read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/FjDBL00f00W0P22q000AA04> . 

Taming the Ecosystem 

Facebook has formally updated its partner program, implementing changes first reported by AdExchanger back in October. Among the notable alterations: the new classification system creates categories for "ad tech" and "media buying" and does away with the "strategic PMD."  Over time the sPMD badge had become an "opaque signal," in Facebook's words. Peruse the new menu. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Bj001W2A0000402B0DgLPqA>  

Mandarin Mobile Video 

Google launched a YouTube channel for Chinese-speaking developers as part of an effort to open up its Android platform to more Mandarin-speaking mobile devs. The channel features original content in Mandarin and curated English content with subtitles. It’s a smart move considering the growing Android saturation in China, where mobile ad spend is on the serious uptick. (Tidbit from the AdExchanger vault <http://go.adexchanger.com/Uq2P04A0LB0WA202j0000hD> .) Google’s relationship with China hasn’t always been smooth – the search giant has tussled with the Chinese government over the issue of online censorship – but in November Google brought its Google Play store to China, thereby allowing developers in China to make money off of apps listed there. More from  <http://go.adexchanger.com/E0A0W0P3BiD000qA2204L0j> MediaPost. 

Raising Tags 

Tag-management solutions provider Tealium raised $30.7 million in Series D financing from Georgian Partners and Bain Capital Ventures, bringing its total fundraising count close to $60 million. Tealium will use the fresh injection to expand its team in the US and internationally and to execute product strategy. Like other companies that began in tag management, Tealium is looking to expand beyond its origins. Many tag-management companies bristle when referred to as such, and their current capabilities have been compared to attribution, analytics and data-management platforms.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic B2B 

In a Q&A with Adweek, Dun & Bradstreet CEO Bob Carrigan reveals the company has programmatic media on the mind. While the company may be known primarily for supply chain management and cleaning up B2B lists and records for clients, “we’ve spent the last few months building a platform in a way that’s useful for agency trading desks and DSPs,” he said. Given its acquisition of B2B marketing data-management firm NetProspex at the outset of the new year and LinkedIn’s similar investment through the Bizo acquisition, B2B marketing data appears in vogue. Read it <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWX400y0ABD00T0iL02P0Aq> . 

Presidential Data 

In a wide-ranging interview with President Barack Obama (scraps of which had been posted last week), Re/code’s Kara Swisher pushes on privacy concerns – specifically, whether consumers own their own data. Generally, the commander-in-chief is pretty vanilla (“I think you own your data”), acknowledging the importance of things most people agree on, like not collecting data on children to sell to them later. He also gives lip service to transparency, saying consumers should understand how exactly their data is being used. Of course, the logistics around how that information is communicated clearly remains a big, unresolved issue. Obama also talks about possible reasons – beyond its history with government authoritarianism – behind Europe’s more stringent privacy rules. “Sometimes their vendors – their service providers who, you know, can’t compete with ours – are essentially trying to set up roadblocks for our companies to operate effectively there.” Read it in its entirety <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A4T0z0P00qD002LBW0YAi> . 

Medium For Adidas 

We often hear about CMOs who need to get more tech-savvy as they work more with technologists. But what about CIOs who need to work more with marketers? CIO.com posted an interview with Adidas Group CIO Jan Brech. Brech discusses the integration of the sports apparel giant’s marketing and IT teams, resulting in a “digital experience team” that combines both disciplines, led by an individual reporting to both the CMO and CIO. He also talks about Adidas’ philosophy partnering with digital marketing companies. In general, he says, he prefers to work with mid-sized companies, like analytics provider SAS, which tend to be more nimble than the IT enterprise tech giants. “The pure startups are usually a little too fragile, let’s say, for a company our size,” he said. “What you want is companies that are strong at being able to correlate your data.” Head on over to CIO.com to read more <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0ZA02q0L0AB0Di00AT4> . 

Twitter CTR Withers 

Facebook drives a lot of publisher traffic. But Twitter? Not so much, at least according to frequent tweeter and The Atlantic senior editor Derek Thompson. Using the new “View Tweet Activity” analytics feature available on the official app, he discovered that a tweet with 155,000 impressions netted just a 1% CTR. “Quantitatively speaking, my viral tweet had the click-through rate of a digital display ad in East Asia,” Thompson writes. “Something I already suspected has now been made crystal clear: 99 percent of my work on Twitter belongs to Twitter.” He concludes that Twitter is pretty much “worthless for the limited purpose of driving traffic to your website, because Twitter is not a portal for outbound links, but rather a homepage for self-contained pictures and observations.” Check it out <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWU4iA00CL0PB002> . 

Digital Radio Dollars 

London lifestyle magazine Monocle has an ear for native. Rather than monetizing via display, it locks all of its web content safely away behind a paywall and turns to digital radio to bring in the cash. The publisher has been running an Internet radio station since 2011 featuring daily editorial programming. It claims 550,000 listeners tune in each month – as compared with its 70,000 print subs. Now, the mag is getting even more deeply into radio with 24-hour programming driven by custom ads products that enable brands to collaborate with editors on show themes. The lines are blurring. Rolex, UBS, GE, Korean Air and Lexus are among Monocle’s biggest advertisers. Digiday has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000D2040qAiLPDBU10WA0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Time For Data 

Faced with a projected 3-6% dip in revenue this year, Time Inc. is bulking up on its data practices, The Wall Street Journal reports. Specifically, it wants to find ways to use big data practices to provide better ad targeting and to find high-growth, underserved markets. Time is also in an experimental phase with its content and considering leveraging ecommerce; it recently built out a site called The Snug to court millennial audiences. The article mentions this initiative could pave the way for native advertising, but considering that IKEA is a founding sponsor <http://go.adexchanger.com/qiAW0A0DLq004L02B0PX00q>  of The Snug, it’s safe to say Time is already doing that. The publisher’s CTO, Colin Bodell, an Amazon vet, is leading the charge. “We’ve only been scratching the surface of the utility of the data,” said Bodell. Time seems to be playing catch-up. Certainly the ideas are sound, but its real test will be its execution. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00i0YL0WrDP0L0A00> . 

Blocked Up 

If viewability and fraud are in the ad industry’s spotlight, it looks like ad blocking is waiting in the wings. At least, that’s what the IAB’s Mike Zaneis told Ad Age. While it seems the collective ad industry is about to have a mild freak-out about ad blockers, it’s with reason: "The blockers themselves have changed their practices," Zaneis said. "Companies that had been whitelisted for years and haven't changed their business practices one iota are suddenly being threatened with being blocked." And surpassing an ad blocker is increasingly a pay-for-play deal. The current situation is that some ad companies – notably Amazon, Google and Microsoft – have doled out dollars to Adblock Plus to get through its wall.

Meredith Gets Krafty 

Following an exec shuffle that has CMO Deanie Elsner heading for the exit, Kraft and Meredith have struck a deal to launch in-email native ads. Meredith sends a hefty 450 million emails monthly, which up until now have only included banner ads. Kraft – which according to associate director Dana Shank has “over 96% household penetration” – seems like a good first partner to trial the ad offering. “We have seen our own content have much better engagement than ads, which are already high, and we were thinking about the value of content, especially in email, and thinking about ways to extend that with other publications,” Shank said. CRM ad-targeting firm LiveIntent will power the spots. Read on at Marketing Land <http://go.adexchanger.com/GiB0AM20Du40W0AL0000P0q> . 

Spotlight On Social 

Data from Neustar’s January media intelligence report suggests that social ad buys constitute 30% of all exchanged-based traffic. But findings also show that reaching target audiences through social channels became 10% more expensive in 2014’s fourth quarter. Video made up about 8% of digital ad spend last quarter and drove the majority of branded content across all channels. Unlike social, video placements predominantly went through publishers and portals, not exchanges. “These results are consistent with the prevalent view that programmatic video inventory is still very scarce,” reads the report. Read on at MediaPost <http://go.adexchanger.com/e00D1A02000BWM0q4ivLP0A> . 

Cybersecurity Legislation 

President Obama signed an advisory executive order on Friday urging companies to make cybersecurity-threat intel available to the government. But privacy groups and tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook and Yahoo are opposed to the order without an overhaul of the NSA’s surveillance program. “I think it’s fair to say that changes on the technology front have outpaced governmental and legislative efforts,” said Andrew Crocker, a legal fellow at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. More via the Washington Post <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0iw0B4L022AAP00q0DM00> . Meanwhile, speaking at the White House summit on cybersecurity on Friday, Apple chief Tim Cook revealed that beginning in September, the US federal government will accept Apple Pay for government transactions.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

MCNs Eye Programmatic 

How will multichannel networks (MCNs) on YouTube, which have traditionally relied on branded content deals, survive in a programmatic world? Ad buyers are used to the efficiency and demographic targeting afforded by software-based buying, according to The Wall Street Journal. Many larger MCNs like Tastemade and Frederator rely on YouTube’s salesforce to sell their pre-roll ad inventory. This has been great to a point, until one considers that YouTube takes a healthy revenue cut. Some MCNs get around this by selling their own sponsorships – a product mention, for instance, for a fee. But as MCN’s proliferate, advertisers wonder whether it’s even worth investing. Reza Izad, CEO at Collective Digital Studio, is working to collect audience data so that he might one day be able to leverage it for future ad targeting. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/v04D00G30ALAWPriB02q000> . 

Pin Overhaul 

Pinterest upgraded <http://go.adexchanger.com/M00A0q0DWG4iA00sL0PB042>  its platform Thursday with “app Pins,” or app install ads that users will see when browsing Pinterest on iOS devices. The tap-to-install feature means users won’t have to leave the platform to install promoted apps. Separately the scrapbooking site is also working on a “buy” button that could launch in the next three to six months. At this point, it’s unclear if Pinterest’s ad and retail products will be integrated but the potential exists, points out Re/code reporter Jason Del Rey. “One could imagine a scenario in which retailers that incorporate Pinterest’s Buy button could also pay Pinterest to promote those images on the platform,” he writes. More on that <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB005WqA000iPGA0t040D2L> . 

Mayer On Mobile 

How can Yahoo make money off advertising? The answer, according to chief Marissa Mayer, is for Yahoo to reinvent itself as a mobile application company. This means more data-driven native advertising products. “We have some of the best data on our platform, as well as across our network,” Mayer said during the Goldman Sachs tech conference on Wednesday. “We can help advertisers identify particular users and target messages to them.” Yahoo had 575 million monthly active mobile users and accounted for $1.2 billion in gross revenue during 2014’s Q4, or $168 million in GAAP revenue. CNBC has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/s06G0Li0DB0u0W0q4P20A0A> . 

Automated Insights Exits 

Content-generation firm Automated Insights (Ai), whose technology is designed to personalize generic content, was acquired Thursday by Vista Equity Partners and will now be a subsidiary of sports tech firm STATS. According to a blog post  <http://go.adexchanger.com/ZB04P0ivA0000q0D720LAWG> from CEO Robbie Allen, the acquisition will enable Ai to more quickly build out its natural language platform (called Wordsmith). Additionally Ai’s focus, Allen wrote, will not solely be on sports. “Vista loved the fact that our technology is generally applicable across many industries and, by extension, many other portfolio companies.” These additional verticals include BI, media, finance, personal fitness, marketing and healthcare.

Conductor Cash 

Conductor raked in $27 million in funding on Thursday, which brings its total raised to more than $60 million. Conductor is in the business of helping brands generate customers from their presence in unpaid web channels like search and social. The platform, Conductor Searchlight, aims to draw marketers away from paid media alone. Conductor works with more than 500 brands, including AT&T, Citibank, FedEx, Overstock.com, REI and Ticketmaster, and boasts a 97% gain in organic traffic on average. "Consumers are speaking louder than ever before; they don't want to engage with banner ads and are getting overloaded with emails,” CEO Seth Besmertnik said in a release <http://go.adexchanger.com/Tx0WG0P0i000DB920L4qAA0> . “Modern-day consumers are actively seeking out their interests and the new marketing is about getting found in those moments. throughout the live event journey."

AdRoll For Onboarding 

On Thursday, AdRoll dove into the CRM data onboarding space with audience segmentation tools for email. “Our customers are always looking for new ways to leverage their customer data. Historically we had focused only on website data, but there is a huge amount of valuable data locked up in CRM systems,” AdRoll President and CMO Adam Berke told AdExchanger in an email. “AdRoll has a unique position as a neutral cross-platform product, we allow our customers to measure and optimize campaigns across a variety of inventory sources, including Facebook. Now, AdRoll customers can broaden the reach of their retargeting campaigns across inventory sources and devices.” Read the blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0i00Gqzb> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Hulu Chief On Viewability, Programmatic 

Speaking to Ad Age, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins said the company has seen “nothing but good news coming out of the viewability debate,” as Hulu only charges its advertisers for ads that are 100% completed and in-view, though he declined to comment on whether CPMs were rising or falling. On programmatic, Hopkins confirmed that Hulu will continue to experiment with automation in 2015. “This year we’re going to really take a look at programmatic from the standpoint of a mechanized way to distribute our advertising to be more user-friendly with our agency partners,” he said, adding that Hulu is aiming to leverage better data metrics and third-party metrics to target on its platform. More <http://go.adexchanger.com/TW0WB0P0i000DBD20L4qAA0> . 

Programmatic Video Sprint 

With a projected growth rate of 204% this year, programmatic digital video is the fastest-growing category under the programmatic umbrella, says eMarketer. According to the researcher, bigger networks and publishers could throw more connected TV inventory into the stew by year’s end. “Though many lump set-top boxes such as Roku, Apple TV or other IPTV-enabling devices such as Google’s Chromecast and Amazon’s Fire TV Stick into the programmatic TV category, they are technically considered sources of digital video given that their content is powered via the internet, though it is ultimately viewed on the larger screen,” eMarketer explains <http://go.adexchanger.com/x0W0000B2Ei0L0B0XA4PDAq> . “With significant demand driving programmatic TV forward this year, such a distinction is noteworthy.” 

Mondel?z’s Media 

While CPG giant Mondel?z International’s Q4 sales slid 7% to $8.8 billion (and 3% for the year to $34.2 billion), it puffed up its margins by reducing costs and driving efficiencies in areas like its media spend. “We expanded margins by driving efficiencies in the non-working elements of our media spend, including significantly consolidating suppliers,” said company CFO Brian Gladden. “We also reduced production costs as we shifted more advertising to digital outlets.” Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/n0WP0FY02q0L0AB0Di00AB4> . Mondel?z’s close working relationship <http://go.adexchanger.com/WW0iZ0B4L0G2AAP00q0DB00>  with video DSP TubeMogul is part of that strategy. 

Torrent Ads 

BitTorrent tapped Rapid Eye Studios to produce and distribute original video content for the BitTorrent Bundle platform, its core ad product. CEO Marco Weber called the deal a “an aggressive expansion into the media space for BitTorrent.” BitTorrent Chief Content Officer Matt Mason was quick to point out BitTorrent’s upper hand on the competition. “Others in the original content space such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu have made great progress, but we are starting out with a big advantage: We have a larger audience than all of those platforms combined,” he said. Read the release <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PH40B0D0Aiq2> . 

Apple CEO: No Data Is Good Data 

In an interview at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference, CEO Tim Cook reiterated Apple’s disavowal of data collection or transmission of any kind.  “There's no need for us to know what you're buying, where you're buying, I don't want to know any of that. We think customers will rebel on that,” he said. “So we think over the arc of time, consumers will go with people they trust with their data. People are unknowingly sharing things with others, and info can be pieced together. Over time people will realize this more and demand privacy.” MacRumors has a transcript <http://go.adexchanger.com/VDB1000ABi0A200WL4qPI00> .

Opera Mediaworks’ Sterling Quarter 

Opera Mediaworks’ Q4 revenues were $103.2 million, a hefty 139% YoY increase. Strong results in mobile video and performance advertising fueled growth, as did international expansion through the acquisition of South African mobile ad network AdVine. Standard caveat: These are gross revenue figures and therefore include media costs. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0i00Bq3K> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Automating Print 

Time Inc. is bringing more automation to its print sales. Its approach, developed in part by MediaMath, functions almost identically to Time’s digital ad sales process. Target is the first brand to trial the offering, Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/kW0vL0000xP02BAqDi0g40A> . “Our overall strategy is to use automated marketplaces as a way to alleviate some of the work we have humans going, so they can do more custom content integrations,” said Target SVP of media and guest engagement Kristi Argyilan. She added that Target’s programmatic tech is growing “exponentially.” 

BlackArrow And TWC 

TV ad tech vendor BlackArrow will begin to power dynamic ad insertion in on-demand content for mobile and connected devices. Time Warner Cable, which already uses BlackArrow’s tech to run ads on linear and traditional VOD, is the first client to trial the new solution. “Time Warner Cable has invested heavily in bringing multi-screen and time-shifted viewing options like VOD and our TWC TV app to our customers,” said Joan Gillman, Time Warner Cable EVP and COO. “It is an added benefit that we have been able to work with BlackArrow and other partners to also help us bring highly targeted and dynamic advertising solutions to these platforms.” The collaboration brings BlackArrow into closer competition with video tech firms like Adobe Primetime and FreeWheel.

NBCUx Update 

NBCUniversal rolled out its digital programmatic offering last year, and the broadcaster’s head of digital strategy, Krishan Bhatia, tells Broadcasting  <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40i0A2x0BxLD0WiP00q0A0> & Cable that client response has been positive. “With clients where programmatic and data-enabled offerings are front and center in their buying, we’re doing anywhere between 20% and 30% of business on our digital properties with them in that manner, which is a real meaningful chunk,” said Bhatia. He added that programmatic media buying will play a big role in TV upfronts this year, and “is paramount in everything that clients are asking [agencies] to do and that agencies are planning to do.” 

App To Web 

Design-centric app Flipboard will extend its digital presence with the launch of a website, and has signed on advertisers such as National Geographic and Fast Company to support the effort. “For the moment, links on the web will just go to the publisher’s website, but we are working on some deals with publishing partners where we can do the same on the web as we do on the mobile app — show magazine-style content and serve ads and share that revenue,” Flipboard CEO Mike McCue told Gigaom. "We can generate formats and layouts like the NYT’s Snowfall, a really visual magazine style, and we are hoping to do that for a number of publishers.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/tAAP2q0xWD0Ly000B4000ij> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Content In The Age Of Efficiency

Writing for AdWeek, IAB President Randall Rothenberg makes a case for “big content,” and reveals that creative will take center stage at the IAB Annual Leadership Meeting this week. Ad tech will help the industry through core impediments like fraud, malware and viewability, Rothenberg said. However, “Going back to the earliest days of the printing press and then broadcasting, it is the commoditization and ubiquity of emerging technologies rather than their closely held, proprietary ownership that feeds creativity, audience growth and commercial opportunities. We believe this state of efficient ubiquity is coming sooner than most people think, which is why industry executives need to focus more intently on content.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/Th0Wr0P0i000DB820L4qAA0> .

OpenX Talks

In a Q&A with the WSJ, OpenX CEO Tim Cadogan addresses fraud-fighting efforts, recent attempts to create native ad standards and what’s next for programmatic. Read it. <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB009WqA000iPrA0i040D2L>  He says it may not be a huge leap to the first programmatically traded in-car ad. “As cars become more autonomous you’ll have a screen or display in your car, for example. Over time you’ll see media on those screens, and then advertising. Those ads could be perfectly suited to programmatic trading, and could change in real-time based on factors such as location and time.”

Oracle M&A Draws Ire

On the heels of Oracle’s Datalogix acquisition, a coalition of four privacy groups wants the FTC to investigate big data and digital marketing consolidation. In a letter <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00aWqA000iPrA0j040D2L>  sent to FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez late last week, the coalition wrote, “The Oracle/Datalogix transaction involved the merging of far-reaching and powerful datasets and applications across key offline and online markets, including financial, retail, auto sales, grocery and other major sectors. It illustrates the crosscutting dimensions of the contemporary ‘Big Data’ digital marketplace, where competition and consumer-protection issues are intertwined.” InfoWorld has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02b000kr00iPW04DABAqL0> .

Google’s Faster Links

Google tweaked AdWords on Monday to include so-called “upgraded URLs.” The upgrade simplifies how advertisers track ad performance and decrease website load times. “With destination URLs, anytime you need to adjust tracking, you have to update the entire destination URL,” AdWords product manager Leo Sei explained in a blog post. “This triggers a re-review of your entire destination URL and your ads stop running while your URL is re-reviewed – causing you to lose time and potential new business.” Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/XAL0PlB00000Ar4Dq02iWc0> .

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Programmatic TV, Pouring Concrete 

Speaking to Beet.TV <http://go.adexchanger.com/qiAW0A0DLQ004m02B0PM00q> , Adap.tv programmatic SVP Dan Ackerman said real-time targerting is not essential to making programmatic TV work. “If you can improve the accuracy of targeting and the accountability a year in advance, that’s a huge move. … Even a week. … You don’t need to have these biddable environments and real-time [ad] insertion,” Ackerman said. “TV just doesn’t operate that way and it doesn’t need to. If you found 10% more accuracy and 10% efficiency on a $70 billion business, the value for everybody in the ecosystem is huge.” Separately, in a thought piece penned for Broadcasting & Cable, Videology CEO Scott Ferber says three main hurdles to programmatic TV remain: the availability of data, systems unification and cross-screen measurement.

Native Is Mobile 

Research from native ad vendor Adyoulike suggests the majority of brands’ native ads are viewed via mobile devices. According to the data, B&Q, Capital One, Domino’s Pizza and UBS are among the brands seeing 55% of user engagement with native content on mobile. “Consumers are moving away from the traditional, both in terms of ad formats and devices,” Francis Turner, managing director at Adyoulike UK, told The Drum <http://go.adexchanger.com/z0qD2AL0004B0OmiWPS0A00> . “The results show that online advertisers looking to engage with tech-savvy, urban, socially mobile 18-34-year-olds would be well advised to embrace native advertising formats,” he added. 

Geo-Programmatic 

Metamarkets paired up with analytics firm Factual to support geotargeted mobile ads. Metamarkets is a programmatic data provider that offers cloud infrastructure to DSPs, and to SSPs like MoPub and Flurry. Factual’s tools have also been licensed by Adelphic and WPP Group. “With the rise of beacon data, I think a lot of that [mobile data] will ultimately inform other areas of the advertising landscape, whether it be display or even linear TV,” commented Metamarkets CEO Mike Driscoll.

Resolving Identities 

Experian-owned AdTruth will release an offering called AdTruth Resolve this week, to go along with its AdTruth ID product. AdTruth ID provides its clients with the ability to statistically identify and link mobile devices in a cookieless environment. AdTruth Resolve is what Americas GM Martin Gilliard describes as a digital resolution technology. “We’ll take a look at the identifiers and signals across all digital devices and tie it into digital identities, household identities, and even use deterministic information,” he said. Resolve is meant to integrate into an existing tech stack. So if you pop it into a data-management platform, it’s designed to align AdTruth IDs as well as all the different identities pumping through the platform to provide that vaunted single-customer view. 

Twitter’s Troll Trouble 

In a telling internal memo obtained by The Verge <http://go.adexchanger.com/o02Q000Um00iPW04DABAqL0>  late last week, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo shoulders the blame for Twitter’s troll problem, which has cost the company users. “We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years,” Costolo wrote. “We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day. I take full responsibility for not being more aggressive on this front.” It’s not surprising Costolo is taking user loss seriously, as that headache took center stage during Twitter’s earnings. Between 2014’s Q3 and Q4, Twitter’s US MAUs remained static at 63 million, though Costolo blamed an iOS 8 bug for that.

Yelp Mixed 

What does Yelp have in common with Twitter? Stalled user growth, for one thing. After reporting its quarterly and year-end earnings late last week, shares of the company plummeted 20% (ditto Pandora). Investors grew wary despite the fact that Yelp upped its annual revenue by 62% to $377.5 million. To attract new users and ease investor concerns, COO Geoff Donaker revealed plans to increase marketing spend to $30 million in 2015 from $10 million in 2014. That figure is “as much as we think we could reasonably spend this year,” Donaker told investors during the call. “But obviously, we're not yet ready for huge amounts of marketing well beyond that,” he added.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Apple TV, The Next Generation 

Apple is in talks with TV programmers to debut an OTT pay-TV service, sources tell  <http://go.adexchanger.com/Lq42AB00i0Og0WMDP0L0A00> Re/code. The service would resemble Dish’s Sling TV product, or the similar service Sony is gearing up to launch. “The theory is that Apple would put together bundles of programming, but not the entire TV lineup that pay-TV providers generally offer, and sell it directly to consumers, over the Web,” writes Peter Kafka. “That means Apple wouldn’t be reinventing the way TV works today, but offering its own version of it, with its own interface and user experience.” 

Data Cabinet 

During a conference call on Thursday, Obama adviser John Podesta unveiled a noteworthy White House appointee. Former LinkedIn head of data products DJ Patil will join the White House as a data scientist-in-residence to help the administration handle issues of data and privacy on the web. More on that via Gigaom <http://go.adexchanger.com/P00000AWLB0PP40g0DNAiq2> . Separately, Ad Age reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/uQ0000DB4L0A0O02gPqWAi0>  that Healthcare.gov continues to share user data with third-party firms like Facebook, Rocket Fuel and Twitter Advertising, with the expressed purposed of targeted advertising. 

TV Matchmakers 

Starcom MediaVest Group, Acxiom and FourthWall Media have hooked up in the name of precise TV ad targeting. Starcom’s TARDIS planning and buying platform will now ingest cable set-top box data from the millions of devices FourthWall claims access to and anonymously match viewing behavior against audience lists at the hashed ID level. This isn’t Starcom’s first go-round with Acxiom. In 2013 it sealed a long-term contract with Acxiom’s data connectivity solution, Audience Operating System, the first agency deal <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0iPA0q0R0BAL0PDg2>  in Acxiom’s 40-year history. Press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/r40S0A2g0BQLD0WiP00q0A0> . 

Search-To-Call Attribution 

Marchex debuted an analytics tool on Thursday that aims to solve “the $4 billion blind spot in mobile advertising.” The tool, Call Analytics, lets marketers track and measure keywords that drive calls from search queries on the mobile web. “Advertisers have been pouring billions of dollars into click-to-call ads without 100% measurement of which keywords produce phone calls and which ones don’t,” said Marchex’s Adarsh Nair. “That kind of waste is unconscionable.” Time Warner Cable and Allconnect are using the tool.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Heineken Grows Programmatic Spend 

Heineken's programmatic ad spend will grow to 10% of its total digital ad budget through a partnership with TubeMogul, reports The Wall Street Journal <http://go.adexchanger.com/I0i0qWD0L4Pk0A2q0c0BA00> . That’s a relatively modest share to spend on automation (remember AmEx and P&G's 70 to 100%?), but three years ago Heineken only committed 5% to digital, and that figure has since grown to 25%. “Our media plans were outdated,” said Ron Amram, Heineken USA’s senior media director, “We were too reliant on TV and radio and out-of-home. Now, we are trying to be smarter, measure our impact and be as aligned with consumer behavior and interests as possible.” 

EU Eyes Facebook 

The EU has repeatedly targeted Google over privacy and antitrust issues – now it’s Facebook’s turn. EU data protection officials have formed a task force composed of regulators from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany to address Facebook’s latest privacy policy. Regulators take particular issue with the social network’s data collection practices across the web through logins or via its “like” button. Hamburg’s Data Protection Commissioner has also submitted a list of questions to Facebook regarding its new policy. More on that via CIO <http://go.adexchanger.com/DWr400l0ABD00c0iL02P0Aq> . Separately, the FCC’s chair introduced a net neutrality proposal on Wednesday that’s ruffling the feathers of carriers like Verizon and AT&T and Internet providers.

Green Light For Publicis-Sapient 

Publicis CEO Maurice Levy may be breathing a small sigh of relief, as his holding company has gotten the regulatory high sign to proceed with its $2.3 billion acquisition of Sapient. The transaction is expected to close on Thursday. Government approval was never seriously in doubt with this transaction, as it was for the company’s doomed Omnicom buy. Press release. <http://go.adexchanger.com/ut0000DB4L0A0n02cPqWAi0>  Separately, Publicis chief strategist Rishad Tobaccowala has joined the board of Matomy in the wake of an investment last year. Announcement. <http://go.adexchanger.com/Ac0o04WB200AiPq00L0u0DA>  Holding company, meet tech. 

Measuring All The TV 

Tribune Broadcasting is strengthening its nationwide TV metrics in cahoots with Rentrak. The publisher and researcher first paired up in 2012 to bring metrics to syndicate stations in Cleveland and Des Moines, Iowa, and this week's announcement brings that enhanced reporting to all of Tribune’s TV stations. “Rentrak’s data will help our stations make more informed decisions and provide our clients with detailed audience viewing information,” said Larry Wert, the publisher’s president of broadcast media.

Bad Coordinates 

A report from Thinknear says the accuracy of location data on major exchanges has decreased over the past three months. Sixty-eight percent of mobile ad impressions studied included longitude and latitude, but only 37% of those impressions include coordinates accurate up to 100 meters. “Over the last 12 months, the available inventory for potential location-aware advertising has probably doubled or tripled, and yet during that time the quality of that data hasn’t changed dramatically,” Thinknear general manager Loren Hillberg told Street Fight. “We attribute some of the drop to the overall growth from the mobile web, where location is a bit more challenging to collect from a developer’s perspective.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/c0402qPW0L0B0iAAq0Dwc00> .

Bing Kicks Tires On Native 

Microsoft’s Bing Ads will experiment with native ads on MSN.com in the second half of 2015, with spots across desktop and mobile. The ads will “pull intent from Bing Ads and extend that into relative programming on MSN,” Bing Ads general manager Steve Sirich told Marketing Land. “If Bing Ads makes it easy for advertisers to test the native ads within its existing interface and the intent signals and targeting prove effective, it could make for a fluid transition for current advertisers to increase spend on the platform,” writes Marketing Land reporter Ginny Marvin.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Direct’s Not Fraud-Free 

White Ops President Eddie Schwartz says fraud concerns persist within automation of direct buys. While advertisers tend to trust that direct deals are less riddled by fraud, Schwartz says that’s not always the case. “We were surprised that programmatic-direct ad buys contained bot traffic, since direct buys should normally show low bot percentages,” Schwartz said, referencing White Ops’ year-end fraud investigation. “We also were surprised that adware was so damaging to some high-volume video campaigns.” Investors Business Daily has more <http://go.adexchanger.com/Y0A470I0P00qD002LBW0TAi> . 

Google Play Malware 

Speaking of malware, a report from security firm Avast surfaced a new form of malware infecting Android phones via apps from the Google Play store. Once the malware is installed, it displays ads in the form of warning messages. But this type of malware is particularly difficult to detect, TechCrunch reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/TJ0W70P0i000DBU20L4qAA0> , as ads don’t begin to appear until the device is restarted or, in some cases, weeks later. Meanwhile, Google’s director of ads engineering, Vikaram Gupta, pens a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/qiAW0A0DLK004702B0PV00q>  detailing how the tech giant is working to combat “bad ads.” 

Neustar’s Growing Marketing Services 

Neustar’s marketing services business is humming along. Read the press release <http://go.adexchanger.com/p0400W0iLA0q0W0BAL0PD72> . The company reported Q4 2014 revenue for that division at $41.7 million, a YoY increase of 8%, and FY 2014 revenue at $147 million, a 17% increase. Neustar has invested heavily <http://go.adexchanger.com/jqMB0i2LW004D0P0AAX0700>  in its marketing services business, though it constitutes only about 15% of the company’s total 2014 revenue of $964 million. The biggest issue Neustar faces is the potential loss of a major contract responsible for just under half ($475 million) of the company’s total revenue. Of this contract’s renewal – the terms of which are up June 30 – Neustar CEO Lisa Hook said, “We’re in waiting mode, as we have been for the past several months.” 

Mobile Is Programmatic First 

Dstillery VP of analytics Lauren Moores thinks mobile is well positioned to capitalize on automation. “Marketers who work with mobile are using it through programmatic means primarily because it came along after the reticence for programmatic on the desktop side,” she told Street  <http://go.adexchanger.com/A70N04WB200AiPq00L0Y0DA> Fight. “If you aren’t using programmatic in any way, you are missing out on the data science and behavior implicit in what programmatic can bring to the table.” But mobile measurement remains problematic, she added, due to fragmentation and an industrywide overreliance on last-click attribution. 

Orabrush Debuts Molio 

Dental hygiene brand Orabrush is spinning off a video marketing company dubbed Molio, backed by $3 million in funding. “Molio was born out of our runaway success at Orabrush, where we built two multimillion-dollar brands exclusively on YouTube,” CEO Jeff Davis told AdExchanger. Molio will produce video creative in-house and use proprietary data to generate video variations tailored to different audience segments. “Molio then scales those hypertargeted campaigns by programmatically serving YouTube ads to the groups determined as most likely to watch the video and convert,” Davis added.

PlaceIQ’s Shiny New Dashboard 

Mobile ad targeting firm PlaceIQ surfaced an analytics dashboard on Tuesday that seeks to help “brands and agencies connect the physical and digital realms,” according to CEO Duncan McCall. The tool, Consumer Insights Platform, analyzes billions of location data points and market data to deliver insights on consumer intent. According to PlaceIQ <http://go.adexchanger.com/wBDA04AWL0000PiR00q2108> , the tool “visualizes ad targeting and delivery, demographic and behavioral distinctions between exposed and converted audiences, and presents attribution and measurement for each line item.” MediaCom and Starcom MediaVest Group are among the agencies using the tool.

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

Adblock Shakedown 

German startup Eyeo’s Adblock Plus is among the Internet’s most widely used free Internet ad blockers, but the company allows some companies to circumvent its filters – for a price. Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Taboola have all signed confidential deals with Eyeo to stop the software from blocking their ads, the Financial Times reports. According to Eyeo, its software has been downloaded 300 million times worldwide and hosts more than 50 million monthly active users, and data from PageFair and Adobe suggest ad-blocking software usage increased 70% in 2014. It’s unclear how much tech firms are paying to be “whitelisted,” but a digital media exec tells FT it could be as much as 30% of ad revenue generated from unblocked ads. Read on <http://go.adexchanger.com/SB0A2A0DL0400WP0i001qjA>  (subscription). 

Murky Viewability Figures 

Publishers are struggling with viewability, but the statistics could be misleading, according to comScore Chairman Emeritus Gian Fulgoni. “When we look at the top 100 publisher sites or video properties ... 90% or so of them have, on average, low levels of non-human traffic,” Fulgoni told Beet.TV. “But, when you start breaking those properties up in a granular sense and look at different sections of the site, you see that half of them have non-human traffic levels that are medium to high. So the average can be misleading.” More <http://go.adexchanger.com/A10k04WB200AiPq00L0B0DA> . 

Video Kool-Aid 

In a Q&A with Ad Age, Twitter product chief Kevin Weil talks up Twitter’s video ad biz. “It's relatively common for us to see advertising videos that get retweeted so many times that their earned views are five to ten times their paid views,” he said. Weil added that Amplify, Twitter’s core video product, has increased Twitter’s ability to serve ad content in real time. On building separate ad products for Twitter and Vine, Weil said the creation process differs due to the format of each platform, and Vine ads post to Twitter either way.

Search Blips 

TechCrunch reports <http://go.adexchanger.com/Q01A0DB0WD2Lq00iA00m4P0>  that, excluding mobile queries, Google’s US search share dropped below 75% for the first time since 2008. Meanwhile, Yahoo search is gaining ground courtesy of its Firefox deal, with Bing searches accounting for 28% of total queries on the browser. “The stats point to a small but still interesting trend, particularly in light of Yahoo apparently gearing up to make a play for a lucrative deal with Apple to take on default search in the Safari browser,” writes TechCrunch reporter Ingrid Lunden. In the search world, even small changes in share can translate into millions in ad revenue, to say nothing of the intent data. 

Rah Rah Rubicon 

Rubicon Project gets some local media love in a piece for the LA Times <http://go.adexchanger.com/NB00EWqA000iP1A0n040D2L> . The piece cites Quantcast’s and Forbes’ favorable rankings of the “advertising automation cloud platform,” as Rubicon calls itself. CEO Frank Addante says the company will continue to leverage programmatic to compete. “Our vision is to automate all advertising, including television, digital billboards,” he said. “I’ve even seen an advertisement on a faucet.” IoT FTW!

 News Round-Up <http://content.adexchanger.com/rs/adexchanger/images/news-roundup.jpg> 

AOL’s Sales Correction 

Details are in on AOL’s sales reorg, and the changes can be spun as a correction in favor of its programmatic business. WSJ’s Mike Shields reports platform division chief Bob Lord was promoted to oversee all ad products, sales staff and technology. About 150 have been let go, most in sales, and a handful of owned and operated pubs – among them The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) and gaming site Joystiq – will be shuttered. WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/s0wX0Lh0DB0a0W0q4P20A0A> . TechCrunch <http://go.adexchanger.com/ux0000DB4L0A0b02XPqWAh0> . 

Google’s Personalization APIs 

Google’s Now app for Android will start pulling outside data from 40 apps. The mobile assistant of sorts, which has similarities to Siri, will integrate third-party apps like Airbnb, Instacart, Lyft, Pandora, Shazam, eBay and Belly to create a more tailored mobile experience. In a blog post <http://go.adexchanger.com/HW0020q00PcDXA40LhB00yA> , Google director of product management Aparna Chennapragada said the goal is to streamline users’ access to information in real time, “without [users] having to ask for it.” Next up: customizing the ad experience? 

Google’s UK Response 

The latest development in Google’s data privacy regulation saga is an agreement reached late last week with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office. The agreement will align Google’s privacy policy with the UK’s Data Protection Act, limiting how Google can collect and use personal data in the UK. Embedded in the document <http://go.adexchanger.com/m0000d2040qAhLPDBXz0WA0>  Google released in conjunction with the agreement, Google outlines seven future commitments to privacy. 

Facebook’s Urban Takeover 

Facebook is rolling out a “Place Tips” feature by installing beacons in eight locations in New York, such as Strand Bookstore, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Dominique Ansel Bakery and music venue Brooklyn Bowl. The service will also roll out in some public spaces, like Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square and the Statue of Liberty, to push location-specific content to mobile device users who opt in. “For now, the service is free for businesses, but Facebook said it could one day sell ads tied to the information, giving it another way to make ads more personal, and potentially relevant,” WSJ says. Read on at WSJ <http://go.adexchanger.com/FhDBL00Ae0W0P2Xq000AA04> .
